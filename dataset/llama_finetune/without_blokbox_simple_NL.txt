The game is played on a square grid board with coordinates ranging from 1 to 14 in both the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) directions, where positions beyond 14 are considered invalid. Two players participate in the game, identified by the colors purple and orange, with purple starting in control initially. The turn order alternates strictly between the two players, such that after one player completes their move, control passes to the opposing player. Each player owns a fixed set of uniquely indexed pieces numbered from 1 to 21, each defined by a specific arrangement of cells relative to a reference point, and the initial board state places an orange piece on cell (7,8) and a purple piece on cell (8,7). On a player's turn, they may either choose to place one of their owned pieces onto the board or perform a no-operation (noop) action; however, noop is only legal for players who do not currently hold control of the turn, effectively preventing a player from passing when it is their move. Placing a piece involves specifying the piece index and the reference coordinates (x,y) where the piece's shape will be anchored, and such placement is legal only if it respects several constraints: all cells of the piece must lie within the valid board boundaries, none of the pieceâ€™s cells may collide with cells already occupied by that player's pieces, the placement must have at least one cell diagonally adjacent (corner touching) to any existing cell owned by the player, and crucially, no cell of the placed piece may be directly adjacent by side (side touching) to any cell owned by the player. When a move is made, the board state updates by marking the newly occupied cells with the player's color, and ownership records are updated to reflect that the placed piece is now used and no longer available for future placement by that player. The game automatically advances control to the opponent after a move is executed. If at the start of a player's turn they have no legal moves available, the game immediately terminates. The scoring system awards a victory score of 100 to the opponent of the player unable to move, while the player who cannot move receives a score of 0. Thus, the objective is to strategically place pieces to maintain the ability to move while preventing the opponent from doing so. The coordinate system, piece definitions, and adjacency rules collectively enforce spatial constraints that govern legal placements and interactions between pieces on the board throughout the game.
