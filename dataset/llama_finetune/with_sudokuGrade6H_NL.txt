The game takes place on a three-dimensional Sudoku-like grid composed of three layers, each containing a 3x3 arrangement of smaller 3x3 cells, resulting in a total of 27 cells per layer and 81 cells overall. The coordinate system identifies each cell by four indices: the first two specify the layer and the 3x3 block within that layer, while the last two denote the row and column within the block. There is a single player role named "robot," who takes turns sequentially, though since there is only one role, the robot acts every turn. The initial state sets up a partially filled Sudoku grid with some cells containing digits from one to nine and others marked as blank, represented by the symbol "b." On each turn, the robot may perform one action, which consists of placing a digit from one to nine into a blank cell. The action format explicitly specifies the cell's four indices and the digit to be placed. An action is legal only if the targeted cell is currently blank and if the digit does not violate Sudoku constraints: the digit must not already appear in the same row, column, or 3x3 square of the overall grid. Rows are defined across all blocks in the same row position, columns are defined across all blocks in the same column position, and squares correspond to the 3x3 blocks within each layer. When the robot performs a marking action, the state updates by assigning the chosen digit to the selected cell, replacing the blank. All other cells remain unchanged unless directly affected by this action. The game implicitly enforces board boundaries, limiting indices to 1 through 3 for layers, blocks, rows, and columns, and disallows placing digits in occupied cells or digits that conflict with existing ones in their row, column, or block. The game terminates when no further legal moves remain, that is, when there are no blank cells or no digits can be legally placed in any blank cell. Upon termination, if the grid is completely and correctly filled with no blanks remaining, the robot achieves a victory and receives a goal value of 100; otherwise, the goal is 0. If no moves are possible but blanks remain, the game is also considered terminal with a goal of 0. The robot may also effectively pass a turn by taking no action if no legal moves exist, as no explicit noop is specified but the absence of legal moves leads to termination. This game models the classic Sudoku puzzle in a layered format where the robot must fill all blank cells following standard Sudoku rules to win.
