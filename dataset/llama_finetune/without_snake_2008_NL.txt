The game unfolds on a board defined by a coordinate system consisting of rows labeled r1 through r7 and columns labeled c1 through c9, arranged in a toroidal fashion where rows and columns wrap around cyclically; this means that moving beyond the last row or column cycles back to the first. Each cell on the board can be in one of several states: blank (b), wall, point, or exit. The initial configuration specifies various cells as walls, points, exits, or blank spaces. The single player role is "snake," who takes turns alone in sequential order, with the game step counter starting at zero. The snake occupies a position on the board initially at column c6, row r4, which also marks its tail position at the start, and the player begins with zero points.

On each turn, the snake may perform one of four possible movement actions: moving up, down, left, or right. These moves are legal only if the cell adjacent in the chosen direction is within the board boundaries (considering the toroidal wrapping) and is occupied by either a blank space, a point, or the exit; walls are impassable. The rules define the adjacency relationships explicitly, specifying how each move translates the snake's position to the neighboring cell. If no legal move is available, the player cannot act, effectively a no-operation scenario where the game advances without change.

When the snake executes a move, several state changes occur automatically. The snake's head position updates to the new cell, and the tail position advances in a pattern controlled by an "evenmove" toggle that determines whether the tail moves forward or remains stationary, effectively simulating the snake's growth or movement. If the snake moves onto a cell containing a point, a scoring event triggers, incrementing the player's points by one according to a predefined scoring scale where points from zero to four correspond to scores ranging from zero to one hundred, incrementally increasing by five per point. The cell previously occupied by the tail becomes blank, and cells previously occupied by the snake remain marked appropriately to track its body segments. The snake cannot move into walls or outside the board, and occupancy conflicts prevent movement into cells already occupied in a way that violates the rules.

The game terminates when one of three conditions is met: the snake reaches a cell designated as the exit, the step counter reaches fifty turns, or no legal moves remain for the snake. The victory condition is based on the snake's points and whether it has reached the exit; if the snake occupies the exit cell at termination, the player's score corresponds to the current points collected, mapped to a final score between zero and one hundred as per the scoring scale. If the snake does not reach the exit, the score is zero. Overall, the game challenges the snake to collect points scattered across the board while navigating around walls and eventually reach the exit within a limited number of moves, balancing growth and movement within the toroidal grid environment.
