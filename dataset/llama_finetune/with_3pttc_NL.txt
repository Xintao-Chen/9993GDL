The game is set on a 7-by-7 grid with coordinates ranging from 1 to 7 in both the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) directions, excluding the outermost rows and columns, effectively limiting play to the cells where both coordinates are between 2 and 6 inclusive. There are three players identified by the colors red, yellow, and blue, who take turns in a fixed rotation order: red moves first, followed by yellow, then blue, and the cycle repeats. Initially, red occupies the cell at coordinates (1,4), yellow occupies (4,1), and blue occupies (7,4), with the first turn controlled by red and the step count starting at 1. On each turn, the current player may either perform a move or pass by doing a noop action; however, a noop is only legal if the player is not currently in control or if the player has no legal moves available during their turn. A move consists of selecting one of the player’s own occupied cells and moving it to a target cell according to strict movement rules: moves can be orthogonal (one step horizontally or vertically), diagonal (one step diagonally), or in an L-shaped pattern similar to a knight's move in chess (two steps in one direction and one step perpendicular). Moves onto a target cell are legal if the destination is either occupied by an opponent’s piece (allowing capture) or is an unoccupied open cell within the board boundaries. Capturing involves moving onto a cell occupied by a different player, thereby replacing that piece. The game enforces that moves must remain on the board, which excludes the outermost rows and columns as valid positions for pieces. After a move, the control passes to the next player in the rotation sequence, and the step counter increments by one at each turn. The game automatically updates the board state to reflect the moved piece's new position, removes the piece from its original position, and maintains all other pieces unaffected unless captured. The game terminates when any player forms a line of three of their pieces in a row, column, or diagonal within the central 3-by-3 area bounded by coordinates 3 to 5 in both directions, or when the step counter reaches 31, whichever happens first. The victory condition is met if a player successfully aligns three of their pieces in any such line; that player receives a score of 100, while all other players receive zero. If no player achieves this by step 31, the game ends with all players scoring zero. The coordinate system and adjacency relationships are precisely defined to determine legal moves and winning lines, and all moves must adhere to these constraints without overlapping existing friendly pieces or moving off the playable board area.
