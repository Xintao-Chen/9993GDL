The game is played on a 3x3 grid with coordinates ranging from 1 to 3 along both rows and columns, though only the four cells at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2) start as green cells; these cells can change colors during gameplay. There are two player roles: blueplayer and redplayer, who alternate turns. The initial state has those four cells colored green, while the rest of the board is implicitly empty or inactive. On each turn, a player must perform an action of the form "placead r c," where r and c specify the row and column of a green cell on the board; the action is legal only if that cell is currently green. Players cannot place ads on cells that are not green and must choose from the designated green cells. When an action is taken, the color of the chosen cell changes to that player's color—either blue or red—while all other cells retain their colors unless changed in future turns. The game continues as long as there is at least one green cell remaining; if no green cells remain, the game ends automatically. Players have no explicit "noop" move since they must place an ad on a green cell to proceed. The board's boundaries restrict all actions and effects to within the 3x3 grid, with the system tracking adjacency and distances between cells using Manhattan distance (sum of absolute differences in row and column indices). The scoring is computed by considering each green cell's influence, which depends on the proximity of blue and red ads as well as the distance-weighted contributions of other cells. Specifically, the influence score for each cell is calculated by summing weighted inverse distances to placed ads of each color, with the weights favoring closer ads. The point difference between blue and red influences determines which player "wins" influence over that cell, and the magnitude of this difference contributes to the cell's score. At the end of the game, the total number of cells each player controls (colored blue or red) is counted. If one player controls more cells, that player receives a base score of 100 points, while the opponent's score is calculated as four times their cell count plus the original count, reflecting a penalty or partial credit. If both players control an equal number of cells, each receives 50 points. The terminal condition occurs when no green cells remain, signaling the conclusion of the game. The player with the higher score at this point is declared the winner. Throughout the game, occupancy conflicts are prevented because only green cells may be claimed, and once claimed, a cell changes color and cannot be claimed again. Distance calculations and adjacency are strictly bounded within the defined 3x3 grid, ensuring all computations remain valid within the game environment.
