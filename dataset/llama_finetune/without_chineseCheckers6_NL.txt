The game is played on a uniquely shaped board consisting of 37 distinct positions labeled with coordinates such as a1, b1, b2, up to i1, arranged in an irregular hex-like pattern. Six players participate in the game, each assigned a color role: red, yellow, green, teal, blue, and magenta. Turns proceed in a fixed cyclical order starting with red, followed by yellow, then green, teal, blue, magenta, and looping back to red again. Initially, various cells on the board are occupied by stones belonging to the players, with specific starting locations such as red occupying a1, b1, b2; magenta on c1, c2, d1; yellow on c6, c7, d6; blue on f1, g1, g2; green on f6, g6, g7; and teal on h1, h2, i1. At the start, red has control and the game step count begins at one.

Each turn, the player in control may choose to perform a move or a no-operation (noop). The noop action is always legal for any player, allowing them to pass their turn without effect. A legal move action consists of moving a stone from one position on the board to another, denoted by the move from a starting cell to a destination cell. The legality of a move depends on strict movement rules defined by adjacency relationships specific to each playerâ€™s perspective, expressed through "car" and "cdr" relations which represent directed connections between cells. A player may move a stone from a cell they occupy to a destination cell only if a particular path of up to three steps exists through occupied and empty cells following these adjacency relations, ensuring that the move "jumps" over occupied cells in a pattern unique to the player's color and the board topology. Moves cannot be performed into occupied cells, and the stone being moved must belong to the player making the move. These movement constraints implicitly impose board boundaries and occupancy restrictions.

When a move is made, the cell from which the stone moves becomes empty, and the destination cell becomes occupied by that player's stone in the next state. Cells not affected by a move remain occupied by their current stones. Control passes automatically to the next player in the fixed turn order after each action, and the step count increments by one. The game ends when either a player achieves a maximum score of 100 points or when the step count reaches 61, whichever occurs first.

Scoring is determined by evaluating specific triplets of cells assigned to each player, referred to as "toCount" sets, unique to each color. For each triplet, a player earns 100 points if all three cells are occupied by their stones; 50 points if exactly two of the three cells are occupied by their stones; 25 points if exactly one cell is occupied by their stones; and 0 points if none of the cells in the triplet are occupied by them. The player's total score is the sum of points accumulated from these triplets. Victory is achieved by the player who first reaches 100 points or by the state of the game at step 61 if no player has reached 100 points.

In summary, the game involves six players moving stones across a complex board according to strict adjacency-based movement rules, taking turns in a fixed order, with scoring based on controlling specific triplets of board positions. The game concludes either when a player fully controls a triplet scoring 100 points or when the turn count expires, with the highest scoring player prevailing.
