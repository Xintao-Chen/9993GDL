The game is played on a 5-by-5 grid where each cell is identified by a pair of coordinates ranging from 1 to 5 for both rows and columns. There are two players, designated as "xplayer" and "oplayer," who alternate turns, beginning with the xplayer. Initially, all cells on the board are blank. On a player's turn, they may mark a blank cell with their respective symbol ("x" for xplayer and "o" for oplayer), provided it is their turn to move and the chosen cell is currently unoccupied. If it is not a player's turn, their only legal action is to perform a noop, effectively passing control to the other player. The game enforces turn-taking by switching control between players after each move or noop. Each action consists of specifying the coordinates of the cell to mark, and a move is legal only if the cell is blank and it is the moving player's turn. Once a move is made, the board's state updates to reflect the new mark, and the control passes to the opposing player. Implicit rules ensure that marked cells cannot be overwritten and that moves are confined within the 5-by-5 boundaries. The game continuously checks for a winning line, defined as any complete row, column, or one of the two main diagonals fully occupied by the same player's symbol. The game ends when either player achieves such a line or when there are no blank cells remaining, resulting in a terminal state. Scoring assigns 100 points to a player who alone has a winning line, 0 points if only the opponent has a winning line, and 50 points in the case of a draw or simultaneous lines. Thus, victory is achieved by forming an unbroken line of five marks in any row, column, or diagonal before the opponent or by having a higher score at game's end.
