The game is set on a coordinate system with positions defined by x and y coordinates represented by symbolic points such as p0, p1, p2, and so forth, extending across a grid that includes both positive and negative values. The environment includes a defined set of traversable positions indicated by the "track" relation, constraining valid locations where players may move. There are two players in this game, identified as red and blue, who alternate turns. Initially, the red player starts at position x = p2 and y = p0 with a velocity vector of (0,1), while the blue player begins at position x = p3 and y = p0 with the same initial velocity (0,1). The game also starts with a counter set to 50, which decrements with each turn, serving as a temporal limit.

During each turn, the current player must choose an action from a legal set. Legal actions include specifying a speed change, where the player selects a new velocity vector (dx, dy) subject to the constraint that each component differs from the current velocity component by at most one unit in either direction (i.e., the new velocity components must be either the same, increased by one, or decreased by one relative to the current velocity), and at least one component must be nonzero to avoid a no-move action. Furthermore, the speed adjustment is only legal if the resulting new position, calculated by adding the new velocity vector to the current position, lies on the defined track, ensuring players move along valid paths. If a player has no legal speed adjustments available or has already resigned, they may perform a resign action, which sets their velocity to zero and marks them as resigned. This resign action is the only legal move in such circumstances.

After each action, the game state updates automatically: the counter decreases by one, each player's position is updated by adding their current velocity components to their x and y coordinates, and the velocity itself updates to the newly chosen velocity unless the player resigned, in which case it resets to zero. Resignation status is recorded and persists. The game enforces implicit constraints such as staying within track boundaries and moving only to positions validated as part of the track. The y-coordinate must not fall below zero to remain within the playable area; crossing below this threshold or the counter reaching zero signals the game's end, establishing terminal conditions. Additionally, the game ends if any player's y-coordinate becomes less than zero or the counter hits 50, indicating the game is no longer running.

Scoring is determined based on players' positions and resignation status at termination. A player scores 100 points if they are in the landing zone—defined as positions with y less than zero and x greater than 20—while their opponent is not. If both players are in the landing zone, each receives 75 points. Players not in the landing zone and not resigned score 25 points, while any resigned player scores zero. The landing zone thus represents a goal area, and the scoring incentivizes reaching it while the opponent fails to do so. Throughout the game, the turn order alternates strictly between red and blue players, with no skipping of turns except by resignation. The game does not support a no-operation move other than resigning when no legal moves exist. This framework creates a strategic race along the defined track, balancing velocity adjustments and spatial positioning under time constraints to achieve victory by reaching the landing zone first or outlasting the opponent.
