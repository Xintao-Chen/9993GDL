This game is a single-player puzzle played on a three-dimensional grid composed of three layers, each layer containing a 3x3 matrix of cells, resulting in a total of 27 cells arranged by three indices: the first and second indices identify the layer and its row, while the third and fourth indices specify the position within each 3x3 subgrid. The coordinate system uses integers from 1 to 3 for each dimension to denote positions precisely within this structure. The sole player, designated as "robot," takes sequential turns to make moves, with the game starting from an initial state where certain cells are pre-filled with digits from 1 to 9, and others are blank, represented by 'b'. On each turn, the player can perform a single action called "mark," which involves placing a digit (1 through 9) into one of the currently blank cells. Legal moves require that the chosen cell is blank and that the digit to be placed does not already appear in the corresponding row, column, or 3x3 square of the given layer and position, enforcing Sudoku-like constraints across the three-dimensional arrangement. Each action updates the game state by filling the chosen cell with the specified digit, replacing the blank status, while all other cells remain unchanged. The game proceeds until no further legal moves are available—meaning there are no blank cells where digits can be validly placed according to the rules—at which point the game ends. Since there is only one player, there is no turn order complexity or need for a no-operation (noop) action; the player must always place a digit if a legal move exists. The board's boundaries are implicitly defined by the indices ranging from 1 to 3, ensuring all placements are within the 3x3x3 grid and preventing any out-of-bounds moves. Occupancy conflicts are avoided by only allowing marks on blank cells, and distance relationships are governed by the Sudoku-like rules preventing repeated digits in the same row, column, or 3x3 square within the relevant dimensions. The goal is to fill the entire board correctly, and the player receives a perfect score of 100 upon successfully filling all cells without violating any constraints; otherwise, the score remains zero. The game terminates when no further playable moves exist, marking either successful completion or a state where no legal digit placements can be made.
