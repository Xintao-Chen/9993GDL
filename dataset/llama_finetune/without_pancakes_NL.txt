The game is played in an abstract environment involving a sequence of six distinct pancake elements labeled p1 through p6, arranged in an initial order of p5, p3, p6, p1, p4, and p2. The coordinate system is implicit in the ordering of these pancakes, with the sequence representing their positions. There is a single player role, called "flipper," who takes turns performing actions in a fixed turn order that cycles through the six pancakes. Each turn, the flipper may choose to flip one pancake from the set of pancakes currently in play; the legality of an action is determined by whether the chosen pancake is present in the current order. When the flipper flips a specific pancake, the order of pancakes is rearranged according to a pattern where the flipped pancake moves to the front, and the order of pancakes before it is reversed, effectively reordering the sequence based on the position of the flipped pancake. Each flip increments a flip count that starts at zero and increases by one with every flip action taken. The game enforces implicit constraints such as the fixed set of pancakes and their unique positions in the order, with no duplicate pancakes allowed, and all flips must be performed on pancakes currently in the sequence. The game terminates either when the pancake order is restored to the original ascending sequence p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6 or when the flip count reaches forty moves, whichever comes first. The scoring system assigns a victory value to the flipper based on the number of flips taken to achieve the sorted order; if the pancakes are sorted in fewer than eight flips, the player scores the maximum of 100 points, with the score decreasing progressively in increments as the flip count increases, reaching zero points if the flip count hits forty without sorting the pancakes. The turn control ensures the player must make a move each turn by flipping a pancake; there is no explicit noop action, so the player cannot skip a move. Overall, the game challenges the single flipper player to reorder the pancakes into the correct sequence efficiently, balancing the strategic choice of which pancake to flip each turn to minimize the total flips required before the terminal conditions end the game.
