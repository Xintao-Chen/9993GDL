The game is played on a 15-by-15 grid where coordinates are defined by integer indices from 1 to 15 along both the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) axes. Two players, named player1 and player2, participate in the game, taking turns alternately. The game begins with a series of setup steps, progressing sequentially through six distinct phases before entering the main play phase. Initially, player1 places black stones during the first and third setup steps, while player1 also places white stones in the second step. Player2 places white stones in the fourth step and black stones in the fifth step. After these preplacement steps, player2 chooses a color during the fourth setup step and player1 chooses a color in the sixth setup step, thereby determining each player's assigned color for the remainder of the game. Control of the turn passes between the players, with player1 and player2 alternating moves once the main phase begins. On a player's turn, if it is their control phase, they may place a stone of their assigned color onto an empty cell on the board; an empty cell is one that is within the 1 to 15 index range on both axes and is not currently occupied by any stone. If it is not their turn or if they are not involved in a preplacement step, a player may perform a noop action, which effectively passes their turn without making a move, though noop is illegal during the players' control phases except for player2 during the sixth setup step. Actions take the form of either placing a stone at specific coordinates or choosing a color during setup; placement is legal only when the targeted cell is empty and it is the player's turn to place a stone. After a placement, the cell's state updates to reflect occupation by that player's color, and control switches to the opponent player. The game automatically tracks and preserves the state of occupied cells and the color assignments of players throughout play. The game concludes when either the board is completely filled with stones or a player achieves a winning condition. A winning condition is met when a player forms an unbroken line of six stones of their color in any horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction, where the line of six stones is bounded on both ends by either empty cells or the board edge to ensure it is not part of a longer contiguous line. If a player achieves such a six-stone line, they receive a perfect score of 100, while their opponent receives 0. If the board fills without either player forming such a line, both players receive a draw score of 50. The game enforces implicit constraints such as board boundaries defined by indices 1 through 15, no overlapping stones on any cell, and the requirement that stones must be placed only on empty cells. The turn order strictly alternates between player1 and player2 after each stone placement, ensuring fair and sequential play. Overall, the game challenges players to strategically place stones to create a consecutive line of six while preventing their opponent from doing the same on a bounded 15x15 grid.
