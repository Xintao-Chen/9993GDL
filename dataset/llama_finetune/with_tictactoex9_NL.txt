The game is played on a three-dimensional board consisting of multiple smaller 3x3 grids arranged in a 3x3 layout, effectively creating a 3x3x3x3 coordinate system where each cell is identified by four coordinates: two for the larger grid position and two for the cell within that grid. There are two players, named xplayer and oplayer, who alternate turns, with xplayer starting the game. Initially, all cells across the entire multi-grid board are empty, indicated by the state 'b' for blank. During a turn, the player in control must make a move by marking an empty cell with their respective symbol ('x' for xplayer, 'o' for oplayer) within a designated smaller grid specified by the current "board to play." If the designated smaller grid still has empty cells, the active player must place their mark within that grid; if not, the player may choose any empty cell on the larger board. Players take turns marking cells following this constraint, and if it is not a player's turn, they must perform a noop (no operation) action, effectively passing control. Each action consists of the role (either xplayer or oplayer) and a move command specifying the larger grid coordinates and the cell coordinates within that grid where the mark is to be placed. A move is legal only if it is the player's turn, the cell to be marked is empty, and the move complies with the rules governing which smaller grid may be played on. Upon marking a cell, the state updates to reflect the new mark, and the "board to play" for the next player is set to the position of the cell just marked within the current grid. The game enforces implicit constraints such as the board boundaries: all coordinates must be within the 1 to 3 range, no cell can be marked more than once, and players must respect the designated smaller grid to play in unless it is fully occupied. The game ends when a player completes a line of three of their marks in any smaller grid horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when no empty cells remain on the entire board, indicating a draw. Victory is awarded to a player who forms such a line, granting them a score of 100, while the opponent receives zero. If the board is full without any completed lines, both players receive a score of 50. Throughout the game, the control alternates strictly between players, and no move can occur out of turn. This combination of nested boards and constrained move selection creates a complex strategic environment where players must consider both their current move and the implications for their opponent's next allowed moves.
