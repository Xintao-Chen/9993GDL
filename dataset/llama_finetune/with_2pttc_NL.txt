The game is played on a grid defined by coordinates from 1 to 7 along both the x and y axes, with the playable area excluding the outermost rows and columns so that valid positions have x and y indices strictly between 1 and 7. There are two players, red and blue, who alternate turns with red moving first. Initially, the red player controls the game and has a piece positioned at cell (1,4), while the blue player has a piece at cell (7,4). Game progression is tracked by a step counter starting at 1 and incrementing by one each turn. On a player's turn, if they have legal moves available, they must perform one; otherwise, they may choose a noop action, which is only legal if it is that player's turn and they have no legal moves. Legal moves consist of moving one of the player's pieces from its current square to a new location on the board according to specific movement rules: the destination cell must either be occupied by an opponent's piece and be orthogonally or diagonally adjacent, or be an unoccupied cell reachable by an "ell"-shaped move akin to a knight's move in chess, where the move covers two squares in one direction and one square in the perpendicular direction. Moves must start from a cell currently occupied by the player's piece and end on a cell within the playable board area. When a player makes a move, control passes to the other player. Moving onto a cell occupied by an opponent's piece appears to capture or replace that piece, as the moved piece occupies the new cell. The state updates accordingly, with the piece's new location recorded and the previous location vacated. The game ends when either player achieves a winning condition defined as forming a line of three of their pieces in a row, column, or diagonal specifically within the central 3x3 area of the board â€” namely, any of the rows 3 to 5 in columns 3 to 5, any of the columns 3 to 5 in rows 3 to 5, or the two main diagonals spanning from (3,3) to (5,5) or (3,5) to (5,3). Alternatively, the game also terminates automatically if the turn counter reaches 31 steps, indicating a maximum number of turns. At termination, the player who has formed such a line is awarded a score of 100, while the other player receives 0; if no line is formed by a player by the end of the game, that player scores 0 as well. The coordinate system and all movement relations are defined precisely to ensure valid orthogonal, diagonal, and ell moves only between cells within the board boundaries and respecting occupancy constraints. The game's turn control rotates strictly between the two players, with the next player determined by a fixed rotation rule. Overall, the game involves strategic placement and movement of pieces by red and blue players on a central 5x5 area within a 7x7 grid, aiming to form a three-in-a-row line to win before the step limit is reached.
