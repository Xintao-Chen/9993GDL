The game "Flipper" is played in an abstract environment involving six distinct pancakes labeled p1 through p6, without explicit spatial coordinates but with an implicit order among these pancakes. The player role is singularly named flipper, who takes turns according to a fixed initial player order sequence p1, p5, p3, p6, p4, p2. This sequence represents the order of pancakes associated with the game state. At the start of the game, the flip count is set to zero, and all six pancakes are present. On each turn, the sole player performs exactly one action by selecting a pancake to flip, where the action is formatted as (flip ?x), with ?x being the pancake to flip; this action is legal only if the chosen pancake currently exists in the game state. Performing a flip action triggers a state change where the order of the pancakes is updated by moving the selected pancake to the front of the order and reversing the order of pancakes that were previously ahead of it, effectively rearranging the player order list. Simultaneously, the flip count increments by one, progressing through a succession of states from zero up to a maximum of forty. There is no explicit noop mechanism mentioned; the player must always flip one of the existing pancakes to proceed. Implicit constraints include that only existing pancakes can be flipped, and the order of pancakes must remain a permutation of the original six pancakes, with no additions or removals. The game terminates either when the pancake order returns to the original sequence p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, or when the flip count reaches forty, whichever comes first. The scoring system awards the flipper player a maximum of 100 points if the original pancake order is restored within six flips; the score decreases in increments as the flip count increases, diminishing from 90 points at six flips to 0 points at forty flips, with intermediate thresholds defining the score slabs. Thus, the objective is to restore the original pancake sequence efficiently, minimizing the number of flips to maximize the score before the flip count reaches the terminal limit.
