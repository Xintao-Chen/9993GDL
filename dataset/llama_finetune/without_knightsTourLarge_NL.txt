The game is set on a two-dimensional 9-by-9 grid defined by rows numbered from 1 to 9 and columns numbered from 1 to 9, establishing the coordinate system for the board. There is a single player role called "robot," who takes turns alone, implying a turn-based game with only one participant controlling the moves. At the start of the game, the move count is initialized to zero, and a single knight piece is positioned at the cell with coordinates (1,1). The state of the board comprises cells that may contain either a knight or a hole; initially, only the knight is placed, while holes may appear subsequently as a consequence of moves. Each turn, the robot may perform exactly one action, which is either moving the knight or implicitly doing nothing if no legal moves are available; this noop mechanism is not explicitly described but implied by the single-player turn progression and legal move conditions. An action consists of a move command specifying the knight's current coordinates (x1, y1) and its destination coordinates (x2, y2). Such a move is legal if and only if the piece at the starting cell is indeed the knight, and the movement conforms to the knight's characteristic L-shaped pattern on the board, moving two cells in one direction and one cell perpendicular to that, with all variants of this pattern allowed as long as the destination remains within the 9x9 boundaries. There are implicit constraints that the destination cell must be within the board limits, and presumably must be a hole cell, as the knight moves into holes, replacing them, while the previous cell becomes a hole after the move. When the robot performs a move action, the state updates by incrementing the move count by one, relocating the knight from its original cell to the destination cell, and turning the original cell into a hole. The holes persist on the board once created and do not move. The game reaches a terminal state when there exists at least one cell containing a knight and at least one cell containing a hole simultaneously, which occurs naturally after the knight has moved at least once. The scoring or goal for the robot is to maximize the move count, which reflects the number of successful knight moves made during the game. Thus, the player aims to prolong the game by moving the knight legally according to its movement rules, incrementing the move count with each move, until no further legal moves are possible or the terminal condition is met.
