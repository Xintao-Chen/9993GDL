The game is played on a 7x7 board defined by coordinates from 1 to 7 along both the x and y axes, with the edges at coordinates 1 and 7 considered boundaries and thus excluded from valid positions for pieces or moves, effectively creating a 5x5 playable area inside. There are four players named red, yellow, blue, and green who take turns in a fixed rotational order starting with red, then yellow, followed by blue, green, and back to red. Initially, each player controls a piece placed on the board at specific starting positions: red at (1,4), yellow at (4,1), blue at (7,4), and green at (4,7). The initial turn count is set to 1, and each player begins with a capture count of zero. On a player's turn, if they have no legal moves available, they may perform a no-operation action (noop); otherwise, they must make a legal move. The legal moves for a player involve moving one of their pieces from a current cell to a target cell according to specific movement patterns: the piece can move orthogonally or diagonally to an adjacent cell occupied by an opponent's piece, or it can move in an "ell"-shaped pattern (similar to a knight's move in chess, moving two spaces in one direction and one in the perpendicular direction) to an unoccupied cell. Moves must stay within the playable board area. A move is only legal if the starting cell contains the player's piece, the destination cell is either occupied by a different player's piece (for orthogonal and diagonal moves) or empty (for ell-shaped moves), and the movement pattern adheres to the orthogonal, diagonal, or ell criteria. After a move, the piece is relocated to the new cell, capturing any opponent's piece present there, and the capture count for the moving player increases accordingly. The game keeps track of which cells pieces came from and moved to during the current turn to manage state transitions properly. Control passes to the next player in the rotation after each move or noop, and the turn counter advances sequentially. The game ends after the 40th step, signaling termination. Scoring is based on the number of captures each player has made, with a predefined mapping from capture counts to goal points, where each capture increases the player's score in increments of 10 points up to a maximum of 100 points for ten captures. Players cannot move onto cells outside the defined board boundaries or onto cells occupied by their own pieces. The gameplay involves strategic movement and capturing of opponent pieces following the allowed movement rules until the fixed number of turns elapses, at which point players' scores determine their success.
