The game is played on an 8-by-8 grid labeled with coordinates from 1 to 8 along both the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) axes, forming a square board. Certain cells on the board, specifically those at coordinates (3,3), (3,6), (6,3), and (6,6), are designated as off-limits and cannot be occupied or played upon. There are two players, named black and red, who alternate turns in the sequence black first, then red, and so forth. The initial configuration places black pieces at positions (4,4) and (5,5), while red pieces start at (4,5) and (5,4), with black having the first move as indicated by control. During each turn, the player in control may choose to place a piece on the board by marking a cell specified by x and y coordinates; such a move is legal only if the targeted cell is open (unoccupied and not off-limits) and results in flipping at least one of the opponent's pieces according to the game's flipping rules. If the player has no legal moves available, they must perform a noop (no operation) action, effectively passing the turn. Additionally, if it is the opponent’s turn and the current player has no moves, the current player may also do a noop. The flipping mechanism involves capturing the opponent’s pieces that lie in a straight line between the newly placed piece and another of the current player's pieces, in any of the eight possible directions: north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, or southwest. When a player places a piece, all opponent pieces enclosed by this new piece and existing pieces of the current player along these directions are flipped to the current player’s color. The control of the turn alternates after every move or noop action. The game ends when neither player has any legal moves remaining. Scoring is determined by tallying the number of pieces each player has on the board at the end of the game. The player with the higher count receives a full score of 100, the loser receives 0, and in case of a tie, both players receive a score of 50. If the game is not yet over, both players have a score of zero. The board boundaries limit play to the 1 through 8 range on both axes; moves outside this range or on off-limits cells are invalid. The occupancy constraint ensures that pieces may only be placed on empty, non-off-limits cells. No explicit moves other than placing a piece or a noop are allowed. The game state updates after every action by adding the newly placed piece, flipping the appropriate opponent pieces, and switching control to the other player. Thus, the game models a strategic contest of territory control and piece flipping on a bounded square board with restricted cells, alternating turns, and well-defined legal move and scoring conditions.
