The game is played on an 11-row by 11-column board, with rows labeled from r1 to r11 and columns from c1 to c11, where certain boundary connections define adjacency between rows and columns. The coordinate system uses these row and column identifiers to specify cells on the board. There are two players, designated as "x" and "o," who alternate turns, with player "x" taking the first move. The initial state sets all board cells to be blank, and each player begins with a certain number of "quad" and "white" resources—specifically, each player starts with 20 quad units and 7 white units. On a player's turn, they may perform one of two actions: "mark" or "block," each targeting a specific blank cell on the board. The "mark" action places the player's mark ("x" or "o") on a blank cell, while the "block" action changes a blank cell to a white state, consuming one white resource from the acting player. A player can only "block" if they have at least one white resource left; otherwise, the action is illegal. The "mark" action reduces the player's quad resource count by one, while "block" decreases their white resource count by one. After a "mark" action, control passes to the opposing player; after a "block" action, the same player retains control and may act again. When it is not a player's turn, they must pass with a "noop" action, which is always legal if the other player is currently in control. The game enforces that all actions target cells within the board boundaries and only blank cells can be marked or blocked; cells already occupied by "x," "o," or white cannot be chosen. The game recognizes squares of four cells defined by adjacent rows and columns to detect winning conditions. A player wins if they form a square of four cells all marked with their own symbol ("x" or "o"), or if they form an "open quad"—a square with three cells marked by the player and one blank cell—provided the opponent has not already won and the board is not open to further moves. The game ends when there is a win, a loss, or no open moves remain. The scoring system awards 100 points for an outright win, 95 or 5 points for achieving the open quad condition depending on the player, and varying points based on the comparative number of white resources remaining if no winning or losing condition holds. A loss yields zero points, and the game terminates immediately upon reaching any terminal condition. This structure ensures a strategic balance between placing marks to form winning configurations and using blocks to limit opponent options, all within the constraints of resource management and board occupancy.
