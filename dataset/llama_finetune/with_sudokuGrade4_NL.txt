The game takes place on a three-dimensional grid composed of 27 cells arranged in a 3x3x3 format, each cell identified by four coordinates: three indices ranging from 1 to 3 that specify the position within the layers and sublayers, and an additional dimension to distinguish between different segments of the board. The coordinate system uses these four integers to precisely locate each cell. There is a single player role named "robot" who takes turns marking the cells. The initial state of the game is defined with some cells already filled with digits from 1 to 9, while others are marked as blank (denoted by 'b'). On each turn, the robot player can perform a marking action specified by the command to mark a particular cell at coordinates (i, j, k, l) with a digit value x. However, such an action is only legal if the targeted cell is currently blank and if placing the digit x does not violate the Sudoku-like constraints: the digit must not already exist in the same row, column, or 3x3 square segment identified by the coordinates. The row constraint checks all cells sharing the same second and third coordinate pair, the column constraint considers cells sharing the first two coordinates, and the square constraint refers to cells grouped within the same sub-cube in the 3D structure. If the robot performs a marking action, the state updates by replacing the blank cell with the chosen digit; all other cells retain their previous values unless directly affected by the action. No explicit no-operation (noop) action is defined, implying that the robot must always attempt a valid marking if possible. The game automatically ends (terminal condition) when there are no more playable moves, meaning no blank cells remain or no legal digit placements are possible. The scoring is binary: the robot scores 100 points if the board is completely and validly filled with digits, indicating successful completion, or 0 points if there are still open blank cells. Thus, the game challenges the robot to fill all blank cells with digits following Sudoku rules extended into a 3D grid until no moves remain, achieving a perfect solution for maximum points.
