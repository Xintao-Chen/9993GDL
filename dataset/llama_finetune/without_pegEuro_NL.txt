The game is played on a rectangular grid defined by rows labeled from 'a' to 'g' and columns labeled from 'c1' to 'c7', establishing a coordinate system where each position on the board is identified by a row and column pair. The sole player role is called "jumper," and as there is only one player, turns proceed in a single-player sequence where the player repeatedly makes moves or chooses to perform no action if no legal moves are available. The initial state consists of pegs occupying all holes on the board except for the hole at row 'd' and column 'c4', which starts empty; the board thus begins nearly full with one vacant spot. The player takes turns by making a single move each turn, which involves jumping a peg over an adjacent peg into an empty hole directly on the other side; if no such moves exist, the game reaches a terminal state automatically. Each action is specified by the command "jump" followed by four coordinates: the starting row and column of the peg to be moved, and the destination row and column of the empty hole. A jump is legal only if the starting hole contains a peg, the destination hole is empty, and there is exactly one peg located between the start and destination positions either horizontally or vertically, with the intermediate position lying directly between them. The coordinate system enforces adjacency and directionality through successor and predecessor relations on both rows and columns, ensuring that jumps occur strictly over one intermediate peg in a straight line either along the same row or the same column, and no diagonal jumps are allowed. Executing a jump results in the peg at the starting hole moving to the destination hole, the intermediate peg being removed (the hole becoming empty), and the starting hole becoming empty; all other holes retain their previous state. The game automatically updates the state after each move, decrementing the count of pegs on the board. No overlapping is possible as pegs cannot occupy the same hole, and all moves must remain within the defined board boundaries. The game terminates when there are no more legal jumps available, indicating no further moves can be made. Scoring is based on the remaining number of pegs on the board: the player achieves the highest score of 100 points if a peg ends up in the central hole at row 'd' and column 'c4' with only one peg remaining, indicating an optimal solution; slightly lower scores are assigned for fewer pegs remaining but without the central peg, and progressively lower scores correspond to increasing numbers of pegs left on the board. If no pegs remain or the count exceeds certain thresholds, the score decreases accordingly down to zero, rewarding the player for minimizing the pegs through valid jumps and ideally ending with the final peg in the center hole.
