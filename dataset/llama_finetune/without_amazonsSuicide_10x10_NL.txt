The game is played on a 10 by 10 grid where rows and columns are indexed from 1 to 10, establishing a coordinate system with positions identified by their (x, y) coordinates. There are two players, white and black, who alternate turns in a fixed sequence: white always moves first, followed by black. Initially, each player has four pieces placed on specific cells: white pieces occupy cells at coordinates (1,4), (4,1), (7,1), and (10,4), while black pieces start at (1,7), (4,10), (7,10), and (10,7). The game proceeds in a cycle where each player first makes a move action, then a fire action, before passing the turn to the opponent. On a player's move turn, they must move one of their pieces from one occupied cell to another cell reachable along an unblocked straight path in one of eight directions—north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, or northwest—provided that every intermediate cell between the origin and destination is unoccupied and within board boundaries. After moving, the piece's new position is recorded, and the original cell becomes vacated. On the subsequent fire turn, the same player must fire an arrow from the piece's current position along a similar unobstructed straight path; the arrow lands on a target cell that must be empty, and this cell then becomes occupied by an arrow obstacle. Both move and fire actions must be legal as defined by these movement and path constraints. If it is not a player's turn to act, they may perform a noop action, which is legal only when the opponent is to move or fire. The state updates automatically after each action: pieces are relocated after moves, the last moved position is tracked, and arrow cells are added after firing. The game ends when the player whose turn it is to move or fire has no legal moves available, thereby reaching a terminal state. Scoring is binary and based on victory: the player who still has legal moves when the other cannot moves receives a score of 100, while the other scores 0. Throughout the game, no piece or arrow can occupy the same cell simultaneously, all movement and firing paths must stay within the board boundaries, and distances between cells adhere to the sequential index relations that define adjacency in each direction.
