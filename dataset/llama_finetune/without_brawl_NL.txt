The game is played on a standard chessboard defined by files labeled from 'a' to 'h' and ranks numbered from 1 to 8, establishing a coordinate system where each cell is identified by a file-rank pair. There are two players, white and black, who alternate turns with white taking the first move. The initial setup places a simplified assortment of pieces on the board: each side has a king, a queen, two rooks, and the rest of the squares are mostly empty, with black pawns occupying several ranks. Control for the first turn is assigned to white. On a player's turn, they may move one of their own pieces according to movement rules specific to the piece type; legal moves must be feasible, meaning the piece belongs to the player in control, it is moved from a cell currently occupied by that piece, and the destination cell must be either empty or occupied by an opponent's piece. Movement rules are standard chess moves for kings, queens, and rooks: kings move one square in any direction adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally; queens combine rook and bishop moves; rooks move any number of squares along a rank or file. Moves must not be obstructed by other pieces along the pathâ€”columns, rows, and diagonals need to be clear for the piece to move accordingly. After a move, the piece is relocated to the destination cell, and any opponent's piece there is captured and removed from play, reducing the opponent's piece count by one. The player in control switches to the opponent automatically after each move, ensuring alternate turns. If it is not a player's turn, they may issue a noop (no operation) action, which is legal only when the other player has the move. The game advances in discrete steps, incrementing a step counter each turn. The game terminates when either player has no remaining pieces on the board or when the step counter reaches 11, signaling the end of the game. Scoring is based on the number of opponent pieces remaining, with a scoring scale that assigns the highest score when the opponent has no pieces left and progressively lower scores as more opponent pieces survive. Victory is determined by these scores, rewarding the player who captures more of the opponent's pieces before the terminal condition is met. Implicit constraints ensure that moves must remain within the board boundaries; cells are identified by valid file and rank combinations, and no two pieces may occupy the same cell simultaneously except during a capture move where the opponent's piece is removed. Thus, the game is a turn-based, simplified chess variant focusing on kings, queens, and rooks, where players alternate moving their pieces legally on an 8x8 grid with the objective of capturing the opponent's pieces within a limited number of steps.
