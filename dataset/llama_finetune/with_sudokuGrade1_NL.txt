This game is played on a three-dimensional grid consisting of 3 blocks arranged along the first dimension, each block containing 3 rows and 3 columns, and each cell within this 3x3 structure can hold a digit from 1 to 9 or be blank. The coordinate system uses four indices: the first two indices specify the block's position in a 3x3 arrangement (with values 1 to 3), and the last two indices specify the cell's row and column within that block (also from 1 to 3). There is a single player role called "robot," who takes turns making moves in a sequential manner; since there is only one player, the turn order is trivially that player acting repeatedly. The game begins with a partially filled Sudoku-like board state where some cells hold digits and others are blank. On the robot's turn, it may perform a "mark" action, which involves placing a digit from 1 to 9 into a blank cell; this action is legal only if the chosen cell is currently blank and the digit does not already appear in the same row (across all blocks in that row), in the same column (across all blocks in that column), or in the same 3x3 "square" block. The player may also implicitly perform no operation if no legal move is possible, as moves must correspond to legal markings. Each mark action updates the cell's value to the chosen digit, changing the game state accordingly; all other cells remain unaffected. Implicit constraints include the fixed 3x3 grid structure within each block and the prohibition against repeating digits in rows, columns, and blocks, mirroring Sudoku rules, with the entire game board comprising multiple such blocks arranged in a 3x3 layout. The game terminates when no further legal moves are available, meaning no blank cells remain or no digit can be legally placed. The scoring is binary: the player receives a score of 100 if the board is completely filled with no blank cells, indicating a correctly completed puzzle, and a score of 0 otherwise. Thus, victory is achieved by successfully filling the entire board according to the Sudoku constraints encoded in the legality conditions.
