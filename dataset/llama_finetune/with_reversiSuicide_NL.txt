The game is played on an 8x8 board with coordinates ranging from 1 to 8 on both the x (columns) and y (rows) axes, where positions are indexed from 1 through 8 in each dimension. There are two players, identified by the roles black and red, who take turns alternately. The initial board setup places four pieces in the center of the board: black pieces are at coordinates (4,4) and (5,5), while red pieces occupy (4,5) and (5,4). Black starts the game with control of the turn. On a player's turn, they may either make a move or choose to perform a no-operation (noop). A noop is legal when it is not that player's turn or when the player has no legal moves available. A move consists of placing a piece of the player's color on an empty cell that is adjacent to at least one opponent's piece in some direction and where, continuing in that direction, there exists a contiguous line of one or more opponent pieces followed by a piece of the player's own color. Directions on the board include the eight compass points—north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest—each corresponding to specific coordinate offsets. After a move, all opponent pieces in all directions that are bracketed between the newly placed piece and another piece of the current player's color are flipped to the current player's color. This flipping occurs recursively along each direction, effectively converting all captured opponent pieces. The control of the turn switches to the opposing player after each move or noop. Implicit constraints include the board boundaries which restrict moves and flips to cells within the 1-to-8 range for both coordinates, and that pieces can only be placed on empty cells. The game ends when neither player has any legal moves available. At this terminal state, the player with the greater number of pieces on the board is declared the winner; if one player has more pieces than the other, that player receives a goal value of 100, the other 0, and a draw yields both players a goal value of 50. Thus, the objective is to maximize one's total piece count by the time no further moves can be made.
