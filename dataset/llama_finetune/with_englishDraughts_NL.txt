The game is played on a checkered board with files labeled a through h and ranks numbered 1 through 8, forming an 8x8 grid. The coordinate system identifies each cell by its file and rank, with valid squares alternating based on file and rank parity, effectively creating a checkerboard pattern. There are two players, White and Black, who alternate turns starting from the initial state where the last move was made by Black. The board begins populated with pawns of each color placed on specific squares: White pawns occupy a2, b1, c2, d1, e2, f1, g2, h1, b3, d3, f3, and h3; Black pawns occupy a8, b7, c8, d7, e8, f7, g8, h7, a6, c6, e6, and g6. Each turn, the player whose turn it is may perform one legal action or, if no action is legal, may perform a no-operation (noop) move. The game enforces a capturing rule: if a capturing move is available, the player must capture; if multiple captures are possible, the player must continue capturing with the same piece until no further captures are available. Control of the turn passes to the player who made the last capture if that player can continue capturing; otherwise, control switches to the opponent.

Actions in this game take the form of move or capture commands. A move action is specified by the piece's current coordinates and the target coordinates to which it moves. For White, a move consists of moving a piece diagonally forward by one square to an empty square; for Black, moves are diagonally backward by one square to an empty square. The king pieces have slightly different movement: White kings move diagonally backward by one square, and Black kings move diagonally forward by one square, also to empty squares. A capture action involves a piece at an initial position jumping over an opponent's piece diagonally forward or backward into a vacant square immediately beyond it, provided the three squares are consecutive diagonally in a line. The piece being jumped over is removed from the board. Capturing moves must be made if available, and multiple captures in a sequence by the same piece are enforced when possible.

After a move or capture, the game state updates accordingly: the piece moves to the new square, any captured piece is removed, and if a pawn reaches the opponent's back rank (rank 8 for White, rank 1 for Black), it is promoted to a king. The piece that made the last capture remains the capturing piece for potential chained captures. The game tracks steps, incrementing after moves or captures unless a pawn moves or a capture occurs, in which case the step counter resets to zero. The game ends when a player has no legal moves available, resulting in that player losing, or when the step counter reaches 20, indicating a draw or forced termination. Victory is awarded to the player who does not lose, with a scoring system assigning 100 points to the winner, 0 to the loser, and 50 points to each player if the game ends without a loser. Thus, the game combines elements of forced capturing, promotion to kings, and movement constrained to diagonal squares on a checkered board, with turn control depending on capture sequences and a step-based termination condition.
