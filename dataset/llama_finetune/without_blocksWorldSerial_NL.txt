This game is played in an abstract environment involving two separate sets of blocks arranged on two parallel conceptual tables, each with its own coordinate system defined implicitly by block positions and clear status. The single player role, named "robot," controls the manipulation of blocks in two distinct phases or subgames, referred to as game 1 and game 2, executed sequentially. The initial state sets blocks 'a,' 'b,' and 'c' on both tables, with block 'c' stacked on block 'a' and blocks 'a' and 'b' placed on the table surface; all blocks 'b' and 'c' are initially clear, meaning no block is on top of them. The player "robot" alternates between two modes of operation: before the first subgame terminates, the playerâ€™s legal moves are restricted to stacking and unstacking actions on the first table (denoted with suffix 1), while after the first subgame ends, the player can perform analogous actions on the second table (denoted with suffix 2). A turn consists of the player performing a single action, which must be legal according to specific conditions: to stack a block x onto a block y, both x and y must be clear and on their respective tables, and x and y must be distinct blocks; to unstack block x from block y, block x must be clear and directly on block y. If the game is over for the first subgame, actions must correspond to the second subgame rules, otherwise they correspond to the first. There is no explicit mention of a noop action, implying the player must always perform a legal stacking or unstacking move when possible. Each action triggers state changes that update the positions of blocks (which block is on which), the clear status of blocks involved, and the presence of blocks on the table. The step counters for each subgame increment with each action taken: for subgame one, the step counter advances from 1 up to 4, at which point the subgame ends and the game transitions to subgame two; for subgame two, the steps similarly progress until four moves have been made, whereupon the entire game terminates. Implicit constraints include the requirement that blocks remain within their respective tables, that stacking only occurs on clear blocks, and that no two blocks can occupy the same position simultaneously. The game ends when the step counter reaches four in the second subgame. Scoring is determined by the arrangement of blocks: the player receives 100 points if blocks 'a' are stacked on 'b' and 'b' on 'c' in both subgames; if only one subgame achieves this arrangement, the player scores 50 points; if neither arrangement is achieved, the score is zero. Thus, victory is achieved by correctly stacking the blocks in the specified order within four moves in each subgame, with the robot controlling all movements sequentially across two phases, each with distinct but structurally similar rules governing block manipulation.
