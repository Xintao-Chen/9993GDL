The game is set in a discrete two-dimensional coordinate system with positions defined by integer x and y coordinates, where the map wraps around horizontally and vertically according to a predefined modular arithmetic mapping that cycles coordinates between 1 and 20. The player controls a single ship that has an initial position at coordinates (10, 10) and an initial heading facing north, with a northward speed of 3 and an eastward speed of 2. The game proceeds in discrete time steps starting from step 1, incrementing by one each turn until a maximum of 50 steps is reached, which triggers a timeout terminal condition. The single player role, named "ship," acts in every turn and may choose one of three legal actions: "thrust," which adjusts the shipâ€™s speed in the direction it is currently facing; "turn clockwise," which rotates the ship's heading 90 degrees clockwise without changing its speed; or "turn counterclockwise," which rotates the ship's heading 90 degrees counterclockwise, also without changing speed. These actions are legal on every turn, and there is no explicit no-operation (noop) action; however, the player may choose to "thrust" or "turn" as desired. When the ship performs a thrust action, its speed components are updated by incrementing or decrementing the speed along the north or east dimension depending on its current heading: thrusting north increases north-speed, thrusting south decreases north-speed, thrusting east increases east-speed, and thrusting west decreases east-speed, with speeds bounded between -3 and 3. Turning actions do not alter the speed but rotate the heading among the four cardinal directions: north, east, south, and west, cycling appropriately clockwise or counterclockwise. After the heading and speeds are updated, the ship's position is updated by adding the current east-speed to the x-coordinate and the north-speed to the y-coordinate, with all coordinates mapped back into the range from 1 to 20 by the modular map function, effectively creating a toroidal board. The game terminates if the ship is stopped, defined as having zero speed in both north and east directions, or if the step count reaches 50, triggering the timeout terminal condition. The goal is linked to whether the ship is stopped and whether it is located at a specific coordinate identified as the planet at position (15, 5). If the ship is stopped at this planet location, the player scores 100 points; if stopped elsewhere, the score is 50 points; and if the ship is not stopped, the score is 0. Thus, the player aims to maneuver the ship through thrusts and turns to arrive at and stop on the planet's coordinates before time runs out to maximize the score. The ship's movement respects the wrap-around map boundaries, and no occupancy conflicts or multiple players exist, so no additional constraints on movement legality beyond those implied by heading and speed apply.
