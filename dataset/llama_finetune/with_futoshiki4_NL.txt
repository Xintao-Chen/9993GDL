The game is played on a 4-by-4 grid with rows and columns numbered from 1 to 4, where each cell can hold either a blank or a number from 1 to 4. There is a single player role called "robot," who takes turns alone. The initial state has certain cells blank and one cell at position (2,2) containing the number 2, while all other cells start blank. On each turn, the robot may perform an action consisting of placing a number n into a blank cell at coordinates (row, col), or alternatively choose to quit. The action "place row col n" is legal only if the targeted cell is currently blank and placing the number n there does not violate any illegal conditions. Illegal conditions arise if the same number n already exists in the same row or column, or if any specified "greater than" constraints between cells are violated; these constraints impose that one cell's number must be greater than another's, both horizontally and vertically, as defined initially. If the robot chooses to place a number, the state updates by filling that cell with the number, while all other cells remain the same; if the robot quits, the state transitions to a finished condition. The game automatically detects terminal states either when the board is completely filled with no blank cells remaining or when the finished condition is reached by quitting. The robot's turn sequence is controlled solely by its own actions, with no other players or phases. The scoring is binary: the robot scores 100 if the board is completely filled without blanks, indicating successful placement without illegalities, or 0 if there are any blanks remaining at the end. The coordinate system implicitly constrains moves to the 4x4 grid, and occupancy constraints prevent placing numbers in non-blank cells. The robot's goal is to fill the board respecting the uniqueness of numbers per row and column and the given inequalities between specific cells, achieving a fully filled grid or choosing to quit to end the game.
