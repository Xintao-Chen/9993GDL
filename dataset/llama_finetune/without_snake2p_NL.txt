The game is played on a two-dimensional grid with coordinates ranging from 0 to 5 on both the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) axes, defining a 6x6 board. Each cell on this board can hold a variety of states, including empty spaces denoted by 'w', or occupied by either the red or blue player's head, labeled as 'redHead' or 'blueHead', respectively. Two players participate in this game, identified as red and blue, each assigned a distinct role and taking turns alternately. The initial configuration places the red player's head at cell (1,1) and the blue player's head at cell (4,4), with a number of other cells initialized as empty. On a player's turn, they must choose one of four directional movement actions: moveUp, moveDown, moveLeft, or moveRight. All these actions are always legal for their respective player on their turn, and it is implied that players cannot skip or pass their turn via a noop action. Each action is formatted as the player role followed by the movement direction, for example, "red moveLeft." Executing such an action updates the position of that player's head on the board according to the direction specified, effectively moving the head one cell in that direction. The game's rules enforce that the head cannot move onto a cell already occupied by an obstacle, the opponent's head, or into forbidden states; doing so results in an error state for the player. The board boundaries implicitly restrict movement so that players cannot move beyond the 0 to 5 range in either coordinate. After each move, the cell previously occupied by the player's head becomes marked as 'f', indicating it is now a forbidden or occupied cell, preventing any player from occupying it subsequently. The game continues with players alternating moves until one of three terminal conditions is met: either player makes an illegal move by moving into a forbidden cell, or the board no longer contains any blank cells where movement can occur. Scoring is determined at the end of the game based on the error states and the presence of blank cells; if a player commits an error and the other does not, the non-error player wins with a score of 100, while the erring player scores 0. If both players commit errors or if no blank cells remain without errors, both players receive a score of 50. The game's objective is to maneuver the player's head to avoid errors while occupying cells strategically, with victory awarded to the player who manages to avoid errors and outlast the opponent within the constraints of the board.
