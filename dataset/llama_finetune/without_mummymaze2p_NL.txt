The game is set on an 8-by-8 grid where each cell is identified by coordinates ranging from 1 to 8 along both the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) axes, with the origin presumed at the lower-left corner. The grid contains walls positioned along the edges between cells, blocking movement in specified directions, effectively creating barriers that players cannot cross. There are two player roles: the explorer and the mummy, who alternate turns starting with the explorer. At the start, the explorer is located at coordinate (8,1), the mummy at (1,1), and the exit is fixed at (8,8). The game state also tracks the current turn step, beginning at zero. On the explorer's turn, the player may choose to move one step in any of the four cardinal directions—north, south, east, or west—or opt to take no action ("move1 nowhere"). Movement is only legal if it does not cross a wall or leave the board; if a wall blocks the way or the move would exit the board limits, the explorer remains in place. On the mummy's turn, the player may move two steps sequentially, each in any cardinal direction, or choose to take no action ("move2 nowhere nowhere"). The mummy’s movement is similarly constrained by walls and board boundaries; if either step is blocked, the mummy does not move during that step. Turns alternate control between explorer and mummy, and the game state updates positions accordingly after each move. A key rule is that if at any time the explorer and the mummy occupy the same cell, the explorer is considered "eaten," ending the game. Similarly, if the explorer reaches the exit cell, the game also ends. The game has a maximum of 50 steps; reaching this limit without either the explorer being eaten or reaching the exit also terminates the game. Victory conditions depend on these terminal scenarios: if the explorer reaches the exit without being eaten, the explorer wins with a maximum score of 100 and the mummy scores zero; if the explorer is eaten, the mummy wins with 100 points and the explorer zero; if the game ends after 50 steps with neither event occurring, both players receive partial scores of 50. Movement legality and game progression are rigorously enforced by the constraints on walls and board boundaries, ensuring that players cannot move off the grid or through walls, and the game state advances stepwise with clear turn control and termination rules.
