The game is played on a board composed of a network of cells labeled with coordinates such as a, a1, a2, a3, b, b1, b2, b3, and so forth up to h3, interconnected by bordering relationships that define their adjacency. The coordinate system does not follow a simple grid but rather a graph of cells connected by specified neighbor relations, allowing movement across one to four empty intermediate cells depending on the piece’s value. Two players, designated as "light" and "dark," take turns alternately, with "light" moving first as indicated by the initial control state. The game begins in a setup phase during which each player places their pieces of various values onto specific valid initial locations on the board; these placements are legal only if the chosen cell is empty, is a valid starting location for that player, and the piece has not already been placed on the board. After the setup phase, the game transitions to the main phase where players move their pieces. Moves consist of selecting a piece of a given value belonging to the player and moving it to a new cell that is either empty or occupied by an opponent’s piece, following movement rules that depend on the piece’s value: a piece may move to an adjacent cell (distance one), or jump over one, two, or three empty intermediate cells, provided all landing and intermediate cells satisfy the emptiness and adjacency constraints. Captures occur when a piece moves onto a cell occupied by an opponent’s piece, causing that opponent’s piece to disappear from the board. Additionally, pieces may disappear if an opponent moves onto a cell previously occupied by the piece or vice versa. The game automatically tracks the first and last captures made by each player along with the values of the pieces involved, which factor into victory conditions. Players may also perform a noop action, but only when it is not their turn, effectively passing without moving. The game advances stepwise, incrementing a step counter each turn, with the control passing alternately between the two players. The game terminates when a player achieves victory by leaving the opponent with no legal moves, or by fulfilling specific victory conditions involving the values of the first and last captured pieces as defined by winning pairs, or when the step count reaches 100, resulting in a draw. Scoring awards 100 points to the victorious player, zero to the loser, and 50 points to each player if the game ends without a winner. Throughout play, implicit constraints enforce that pieces remain on the board cells, moves respect the adjacency and emptiness conditions, and no two pieces occupy the same cell simultaneously. The intricate set of bordering relationships and the variable movement distances defined by piece values create a complex strategic environment where players must carefully place and maneuver their pieces to capture opponents, avoid entrapment, and achieve the victory conditions.
