The game is played on a grid defined by files labeled a through d and ranks numbered 1 through 4, establishing a coordinate system where each cell is identified by a file and a rank. Two players, designated white and black, participate by taking turns alternately, with white moving first. The initial setup places mostly blank cells with black pieces occupying most of the board except for white's king positioned at c1 and white's rook at d1; black's king starts at a4. Each turn, the player in control may perform a move action or, if it is not their turn, must execute a no-operation (noop). Moves are specified by indicating a piece type (king or rook), its current coordinates, and the target coordinates to which it moves. For white, legal moves involve moving the white king or rook to an unoccupied cell that is not restricted, following their respective movement rules: the king moves one square in any adjacent direction, and the rook moves any number of squares along a clear row or column without obstruction. Black's legal moves involve moving the black king to an unoccupied cell that is not attacked or guarded, also following king movement rules. The noop action is legal for a player only when it is not their turn to move, effectively passing control to the opponent. Pieces move according to defined adjacency and successor relationships among files and ranks, with movement legality constrained by occupancy and safety conditions; for example, a rook's path must be clear, and kings cannot move into squares attacked by opposing pieces. After a move, the game state updates by relocating the moved piece to its new cell and marking the previous cell as blank; additionally, any cell adjacent to the destination that was blank before the move and adjacent to the piece's new location is updated accordingly. Control switches to the other player, and the step counter increments by one with each move. The game terminates either when a checkmate condition occurs—where the black king is attacked and has no legal moves—or when the step counter reaches four, marking the end of the game. Scoring is binary: white receives 100 points upon achieving checkmate and zero otherwise, while black receives 100 points if checkmate has not been reached and zero if it has. Thus, victory is achieved by white delivering checkmate within four steps; otherwise, black wins.
