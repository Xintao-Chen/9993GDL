This game is played on a grid defined by columns labeled from 'a' through 'i' and rows numbered from 1 to 9, creating a coordinate system where each cell is identified by a column and a row. Two players participate, designated as white and black, who alternate turns with white taking the first move. Initially, all cells are empty except for two pawns: the white pawn is positioned at column 'a' row 5, and the black pawn at column 'i' row 5. The game state also includes walls placed between cells along vertical boundaries between adjacent columns and rows; initially, all walls are set to 'none', indicating no obstacles, and each player starts with four walls they can place during the game. On a player's turn, they may either move their pawn or place a wall, or choose to do nothing by issuing a noop action. The noop is always a legal action and results in no changes to the board state except passing the turn to the opponent. A move action involves moving the player's pawn from its current cell to an adjacent cell either vertically or horizontally, subject to movement rules: the destination cell must be empty, and there must be no walls blocking the path between the source and destination cells. Specifically, pawns can move only along adjacent cells in the same column or between adjacent columns if the walls between them are absent. The place action allows a player to place a wall on a segment between two adjacent rows along a boundary between two adjacent columns, reducing their remaining walls by one; however, walls can only be placed where no wall currently exists and must be placed on two consecutive row boundaries simultaneously, ensuring that the wall occupies a valid continuous portion of the board. After any action, the game state updates accordingly: pawn positions change with moves, walls update with placements, and control switches to the other player. The game implicitly enforces boundaries of the board so that pawns and walls cannot be placed outside the defined 9-row by 9-column grid, and no two pawns may occupy the same cell. The game proceeds up to a maximum of 30 steps; reaching this step count ends the game in a draw with equal scoring unless a player achieves the victory condition first. Victory is achieved if the white pawn reaches any cell in the rightmost column 'i' or if the black pawn reaches any cell in the leftmost column 'a'. Upon such a condition, the player who reached the opposing side wins with a score of 100, while the opponent scores 0. If neither player reaches the opposite side by step 31, the game terminates with both players scoring 50, representing a draw. Thus, the game combines strategic pawn movement and wall placement on a grid with alternating turns, bounded movement constrained by walls, and a race to reach the opponentâ€™s starting side within a fixed number of turns.
