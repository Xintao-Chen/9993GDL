The game "Flipper" is played within an abstract environment involving eight distinct player roles labeled p1 through p8, arranged initially in the turn order p6, p1, p7, p5, p3, p8, p4, and p2. The turn order is represented as a sequence of these players, and the game state keeps track of this order along with a flip count that begins at zero. On each turn, the single role "flipper" may perform one action: flipping one of the pancakes identified as p1 through p8. The legality of an action depends solely on whether the targeted pancake currently exists in the game state. When the "flipper" chooses to flip pancake p1, the turn order remains unchanged for the next state. However, flipping any other pancake causes a rotation of the turn order such that the flipped pancake moves to the front of the sequence, effectively permuting the order by placing the flipped pancake first and shifting the preceding pancakes accordingly. Each flip increments the flip count by one. Turns proceed continuously with the "flipper" making a choice each time, and there is no explicit noop action; the game requires flipping one pancake each turn. Implicit constraints include the fixed set of eight pancakes and the maintenance of a valid permutation of the eight players as the turn order. The game terminates when either the turn order returns to the original sequence p1 through p8 in ascending order or when the flip count reaches 40. The scoring system assigns a numeric goal value to the "flipper" role based on the state of the turn order and the flip count. If the turn order is restored to p1 through p8, the score depends on how many flips have been made: the highest score of 100 is awarded if fewer than six flips have occurred, with gradually decreasing scores as the flip count increases. If the flip count reaches 40, the game ends with a score of zero. Thus, the objective is to restore the original player order in as few flips as possible, balancing the number of moves taken with the final state of the turn order to maximize the score.
