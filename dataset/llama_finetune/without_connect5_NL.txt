This game takes place on an 8x8 grid defined by the coordinates a through h along both the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) axes, forming a square board with cells identified by pairs such as (a,a), (b,c), and so forth. There are two players, designated as "x" and "o," who alternate turns, with player "x" starting the game initially in control. Each cell on the board begins in an unoccupied state, marked by "b" for blank, and initially, every cell is blank. On a player's turn, they may perform an action to mark a single empty cell with their symbol ("x" or "o"), thereby claiming that position. The format of an action is a mark command specifying the coordinates of the cell the player wishes to claim, and this move is legal only if the cell is currently blank and it is the acting player's turn. Alternatively, if it is not a player's turn, their only legal action is a noop, representing a pass or no operation. After a player marks a cell, control passes to the other player automatically. The state updates by changing the marked cell from blank to the player's symbol, while all other cells remain as they were unless marked anew. The boardâ€™s boundaries are implicitly enforced, as only coordinates from a to h are valid, and no cell may be occupied by more than one mark. The game ends when either player achieves a line of exactly five of their own marks consecutively in any row, column, or along either of the two diagonal directions, or when no empty cells remain on the board, resulting in a terminal state. A line of five is defined by five contiguous cells along one of these directions, with each adjacent pair of cells connected by their sequential coordinates (e.g., a to b, b to c, etc.). Victory is awarded to the player who first forms such a five-in-a-row line, granting them a perfect score of 100 points, while the opponent receives zero. If no such line exists and the board is full, both players receive a score of 50 points, indicating a draw or stalemate. This structure ensures a strategic contest where players strive to outmaneuver each other by claiming contiguous sequences of cells before the opponent, carefully managing the spatial relationships and timing of their moves within the confines of the square grid.
