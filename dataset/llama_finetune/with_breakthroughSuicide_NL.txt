The game takes place on an 8-by-8 grid with coordinates ranging from 1 to 8 along both the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) axes. There are two players, White and Black, who alternate turns with White moving first. Initially, White's pieces occupy all cells in the first two rows (y=1 and y=2) across all columns (x=1 to 8), while Black's pieces occupy all cells in the last two rows (y=7 and y=8) across all columns. On a player's turn, they may either move one of their pieces or perform a noop (no operation) if it is the opponent's turn. Legal moves for White involve moving a piece forward by one cell vertically (from y to y+1) either straight ahead or diagonally by one cell horizontally (x to x±1), provided the destination cell is empty or not already occupied by another White piece; similarly, Black moves pieces forward by one cell vertically downward (from y to y−1) either straight ahead or diagonally by one cell horizontally (x to x±1), again only into empty cells or those not occupied by another Black piece. Moves cannot be made to cells occupied by friendly pieces, and the board boundaries (x and y values between 1 and 8) constrain movement. After a move, the piece occupies the new cell, and the previous cell becomes empty. Control switches to the other player after each move. Noops are only legal when it is not the player's turn, effectively passing control to the opponent. The game ends (terminal state) when either White occupies any cell on the last row (y=8), Black occupies any cell on the first row (y=1), or when one player has no pieces left on the board. Victory is awarded to White if White meets the winning condition or Black loses all pieces; Black wins if Black reaches the first row or White loses all pieces. The winning player receives a score of 100, while the losing player receives 0. This setup creates a strategic race where each player attempts to advance their pieces across the board while preventing the opponent from doing the same or eliminating their pieces.
