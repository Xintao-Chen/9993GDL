The game is played on a board consisting of multiple specified locations arranged in a coordinate system labeled with letters a through f and numbers 1 through 6, such as a3, c5, and f4. There are two players, named red and teal, who alternate turns, with red taking the first move as indicated by the control variable initially set to red. The initial board state places red pieces on locations a3, a4, b3, and b4, while teal pieces occupy c1, c2, d1, and d2; the remaining specified locations start blank. On each turn, the player in control may either move a piece or perform a noop action. A move consists of specifying a source location occupied by the player's piece and a target location that is blank and reachable based on predefined adjacency relations unique to each playerâ€™s movement paths. Moves are legal only if the source contains the player's piece and the destination is reachable according to a chain of adjacent positions defined by player-specific "car" relations, ensuring moves correspond to valid steps along these paths. The noop action is legal either if it is the opponent's turn (allowing a player to pass) or if the current player has no movable pieces, determined by the inability to legally move any of their four pieces. Upon a move, the piece is transferred from the source to the destination cell, leaving the source blank, while all other cells remain unchanged; performing noop actions leaves the board state unaltered. Control alternates between red and teal after each turn, and the game advances a step counter incrementing from 1 up to a maximum of 40. The game terminates when 40 steps have occurred or when one player has achieved a winning condition defined as occupying all four of their designated goal cells, which are e3, e4, f3, and f4 for red, and c5, c6, d5, and d6 for teal. Scoring is based on how many of these target cells a player controls at termination or when a player first occupies all four, with a maximum score of 100 awarded for complete control of these cells. Partial control yields descending scores of 75, 50, 25, or 0 depending on the number of goal cells occupied. If a player first achieves full control, they become the "first" and gain maximum points, while the opponent scores less accordingly. The game enforces implicit constraints such as the board boundaries represented by the predefined locations, the occupancy of cells by only one piece or blank, and movement restricted to adjacency relations unique to each player, which simulate paths pieces can traverse. These rules ensure that pieces cannot move arbitrarily but must follow a sequence of steps through permitted adjacent cells. Overall, the game challenges players to strategically move their pieces along these paths to dominate key target locations within a limited number of turns, with victory determined by relative control of these cells and timely occupation.
