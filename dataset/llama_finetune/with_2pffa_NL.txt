The game is played on a 7 by 7 board defined by coordinates from 1 to 7 along both the x and y axes, excluding the outermost rows and columns, effectively limiting playable positions to cells where both coordinates are between 2 and 6 inclusive. There are two players distinguished by colors: red and blue. Play alternates between these players, starting with red. Initially, a red piece is placed at cell (1,4) and a blue piece at (7,4), though these starting positions lie outside the playable area as defined by the onboard predicate; however, they represent the spawn points for each player. The game proceeds in discrete steps, beginning at step 1 and terminating after step 31. On each turn, the player in control may perform a legal move or choose to perform a noop action; noop is only legal if the player currently in control has no legal moves available or if it is the other player's turn. A move action is denoted by move x1 y1 x2 y2, indicating that a piece belonging to the current player moves from coordinates (x1,y1) to (x2,y2). For a move to be legal, the piece must be located at the source cell, and the destination cell must be either occupied by an opponent's piece in an orthogonal or diagonal direction or be an unoccupied cell reachable via an "ell"-shaped move resembling a knight's move in chess. The orthogonal moves connect cells differing by one unit in either x or y, diagonal moves connect cells differing by one unit in both x and y, and ell moves connect cells differing by two units in one coordinate and one unit in the other. Moves must remain within the onboard area, meaning that the destination cell must lie within the defined playable coordinates. The game enforces that a player cannot move onto a cell occupied by their own piece. When a move is made to a cell occupied by an opponent's piece, a capture occurs, incrementing the player's capture count by one. The control then switches to the other player as defined by a rotation relation. The game state updates by moving the piece to the destination cell and clearing the original cell, except for cases where spawning occurs, which can place a piece on a cell. The step counter increments after each move. The game ends when the step count reaches 31. Scoring is based on the total number of captures each player has made, with a linear scale where zero captures yield zero points and each capture increases the score by ten points up to a maximum of 100 points at ten captures; scores do not increase beyond ten captures. The player with the higher score at the end of the game is considered the winner. The game implicitly restricts movement and occupancy to within the board boundaries, forbids overlapping pieces of the same color, and requires that moves obey the specific geometric patterns described. No other explicit spawning rules are defined beyond the initial spawn points. Overall, the gameplay centers on moving pieces in orthogonal, diagonal, or knight-like patterns to capture opposing pieces, accumulating points, and alternating turns until the step limit is reached.
