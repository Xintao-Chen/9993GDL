The game is set in a simple environment comprising two rooms labeled 'a' and 'b', with an implicit coordinate system defined by a set of discrete directions that include compass points such as west, northwest, north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, and several variants of southwest, along with a special direction called 'straight'. There is only one player role named "walker," who takes turns alone in the game. The initial state places the walker in room 'a' at step 1. Each turn, the walker may choose to perform a walk action, specified by two directions: the first and the second arguments must both be valid directions from the predefined set. This action represents the walker's movement attempt. The only legal action for the walker at any turn is to walk by specifying two directions; there is no explicit noop action defined, so the walker must always choose a walk action. The game's state evolves in discrete steps, with the step count incrementing by one automatically each turn. If the walker chooses to walk straight and straight, they remain in room 'a'; any other combination of directions results in the walker moving to room 'b', and once in room 'b', the walker remains there regardless of subsequent moves. Implicit spatial constraints arise from the legal directions, but the actual spatial layout or distances are abstracted away, as no explicit coordinate changes are specified beyond room transitions. The game terminates automatically when step 200 is reached. The scoring is binary and tied to the walker's room: if the walker remains in room 'a' at any step less than or equal to 200, they achieve a goal value of 100; if the walker is in room 'b' at any time, the goal value is 0. Thus, the walker aims to stay in room 'a' for as many steps as possible until the game ends at step 200 to maximize their score.
