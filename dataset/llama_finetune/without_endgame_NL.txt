The game is played on an 8-by-8 board with coordinates labeled by columns from 'a' to 'h' and rows from 1 to 8, where each cell can be occupied by a piece or be empty. There are two players, White and Black, who alternate turns starting with White. Initially, nearly all cells are empty except for White's king positioned at e1, White's rook at h1, and Black's king at d8; it is White's turn to move first, and the game step counter starts at 1. On a player's turn, they may either move a piece according to legal move rules or, if it is not their turn, perform a no-operation (noop). Moves are represented by actions specifying the piece to move, its current coordinates, and the destination coordinates; for White, legal moves include moving the king or rook to an empty cell that is not restricted, while Black can move only the king to an empty cell that is neither attacked nor guarded. The king moves one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to an adjacent square, whereas the rook moves any number of squares along a clear row or column without jumping over other pieces. Restrictions on Black's king movement include avoiding squares attacked by White's rook or guarded by White's king, while White's pieces cannot move into restricted squares. After a move, the piece occupies the destination cell, and the origin cell becomes empty. Control switches to the opposing player, and the step counter increments by one. The game implicitly enforces board boundaries and rules of adjacency for movement, preventing pieces from moving off the board or onto occupied squares except when capturing is not allowed here. The game ends either when a checkmate occurs—defined as Black's king being attacked and unable to move to any safe square—or when 15 steps have been completed. Scoring is binary: White wins with a score of 100 if checkmate is achieved, otherwise zero, and Black wins with 100 points if the game ends without checkmate, otherwise zero. The objective for White is to checkmate Black within 15 moves, while Black aims to avoid checkmate until the step limit is reached.
