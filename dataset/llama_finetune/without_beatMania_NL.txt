This game is played in a vertical coordinate system where blocks are positioned at discrete heights along three columns labeled 1, 2, and 3 on the horizontal axis. The vertical positions range from 1 at the bottom to 30 at the top, with each block's y-coordinate decreasing as it moves downwards. There are two roles: "random" and "player," which take turns sequentially, with the random role acting first by placing blocks and the player responding by attempting to catch them. The initial state starts with zero blocks dropped and zero blocks caught. On the random role's turn, it may place a new block into any of the three columns at the top position (y=30), provided fewer than 30 blocks have been dropped so far; once 30 blocks have been dropped, random must take a noop action, effectively passing the turn without placing a block. The player's legal actions consist of playing a catch attempt in any of the three columns. An action by random placing a block in a column causes that block to appear at height 30 in that column during the next state, and increments the count of blocks dropped by one. Each turn advances all existing blocks down one position, decreasing their y-coordinate by one. When the player attempts to catch a block in a particular column, the catch is successful only if there is a block exactly at position y=1 in that column; a successful catch increases the count of blocks caught. The game enforces boundaries such that blocks cannot exist below y=1, and only one block can occupy a given column at any given height. The game terminates after 30 blocks have been dropped and there are no blocks remaining at the bottom row in any of the three columns. Upon termination, the player's score is determined by the number of blocks caught, mapped through a predefined scoring table that assigns increasing point values up to 100 for catching all 30 blocks. The goal for the random role is fixed at 100 points, while the player aims to maximize their score according to the number of catches. This setup creates a turn-based dynamic where blocks continuously descend, the random role introduces new blocks until the quota is met, and the player must time their catch actions precisely at the bottom row to maximize their score before the game concludes.
