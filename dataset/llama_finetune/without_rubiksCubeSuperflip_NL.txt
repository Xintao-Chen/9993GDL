The game is played in a single-player environment where the player takes on the role of a robot manipulating a three-dimensional puzzle composed of individual pieces called cubies, each identified by unique labels corresponding to their colored faces, such as "yo," "yb," and "wr." The coordinate system is implicit in the arrangement and orientation of these cubies, which occupy positions designated as corners or edges on the puzzle. The initial state sets the step counter to zero and places each cubie in a specific starting position with an initial orientation, either 0 or 1, representing their rotational alignment. The sole player, the robot, takes turns sequentially, with only one turn per step, and has the option to perform one of several legal actions on each turn: a rotation labeled as "turn" with a direction parameter chosen from up, down, left, right, front, or back moves, combined with an angle of 90, 180, or 270 degrees, or to perform a noop action that results in no change. Actions are legal if the specified move direction is valid, and the turn action must be one of the specified rotation angles; the noop is always legal. When a rotation action is performed, all cubies affected by that move are repositioned according to the move's defined "after" relationships, which specify how cubies cycle through positions as a result of the rotation; unaffected cubies retain their positions. Additionally, the orientations of corner cubies affected by the rotation are updated by adding a move-specific orientation effect, cycling through orientation states accordingly, while edge cubie orientations flip or remain unchanged depending on the rotation angle. If the action is noop, all cubies maintain their current positions and orientations. The game automatically increments the step count after each turn. Implicit constraints ensure that cubies remain within the puzzleâ€™s structure, and moves only cycle pieces among predefined neighboring positions without overlapping. The game terminates either when all cubies are correctly positioned and oriented, which means each cubie occupies its designated position with orientation zero, or when the step count reaches 50, whichever occurs first. The scoring system assigns a goal value equal to the count of correctly placed and oriented cubies at termination, with zero score before the game ends. The objective is to maximize the number of correctly aligned cubies within the allowed steps by applying appropriate rotations or choosing to pass with noop actions.
