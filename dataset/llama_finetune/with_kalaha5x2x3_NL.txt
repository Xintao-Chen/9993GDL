The game is played on a circular board consisting of ten normal pits labeled p1 through p10, and two special scoring pits named pwinnorth and pwinsouth, each associated with one of the two players: north and south. The pits are arranged such that each pit has a "next" pit in a sequence that loops around the board, with the scoring pits positioned between certain normal pits, allowing stones to cycle through the board in a fixed order. The players north and south each control five normal pits on opposite sides of the board: north owns p6 through p10, while south owns p1 through p5. At the start of the game, all pits contain three stones each, except the scoring pits which start empty, and the north player has the initial control of the turn. Players alternate turns, with the control passing according to the actions taken, or passing to the opponent if a noop is played when it is not their turn.

During a player's turn, they may perform one of several actions depending on the game state and their hand status, which indicates whether they are currently holding stones or not. If it is a player's turn, and the other player still has stones in their pits, the player may pick up all stones from one of their own non-empty pits, provided they are not already holding any stones. After picking stones, the player must then place them one by one into subsequent pits in the sequence, starting from the pit following the one picked, by executing put actions. The put action requires that the player is holding stones (hand not s0) and specifies the pit into which to place a stone; the pit must be the current position of the stones being sown. If the last stone lands in a scoring pit belonging to the player and some conditions about emptiness of pits opposite to the landing pit are met, special scoring rules apply, potentially capturing stones from opposite pits and adding them to the scoring pit. If the last stone lands in an empty pit on the player's side, capturing may also occur by taking stones from the opposite pit. The player may also clear a pit, which removes all stones from that pit and adds them to the player's scoring pit, but this action is only legal if the opponent's pits are all empty and the player is not holding any stones. If it is not a player's turn, their only legal move is noop, which essentially passes control without changing the game state. Additionally, a player must play noop if all their pits are empty and they hold no stones.

The game enforces several implicit constraints: actions must target pits owned by the player or valid pits in the sequence; placing stones must follow the next pit sequence order; the hand status must be consistent with picking or putting stones; and players cannot pick or clear empty pits. The control of turns changes as follows: after a pick or clear action, the same player retains control; after a put action, control passes to the other player if the last stone was not placed in the player's scoring pit with a single stone in hand; otherwise, the player may continue. The game ends when all pits owned by both players are empty, meaning no more stones remain to be played. The scoring is determined by the number of stones in each player's scoring pit, with a mapping from the stone count to a numerical score. The player with the higher score in their scoring pit at the end wins the game. Throughout play, the game state evolves automatically according to the rules governing stone movement, captures, and pit emptiness, ensuring the circular sowing of stones and scoring mechanics reflect traditional mancala-like gameplay on the specified board layout.
