The game is played on a grid defined by columns labeled from 'a' through 'j' and rows numbered from 'r01' to 'r10', forming a 10-by-10 board. Each cell on this board is initially empty, marked by the symbol 'b'. There is a single player role who takes turns sequentially to make moves, with the initial step labeled as s1. The game progresses in discrete steps, incrementing from s1 through s11, after which the game terminates. On each turn, the player may perform an action described as placing a queen piece on any empty cellâ€”specifically, an action formatted as "place x y," where x is a column coordinate from 'a' to 'j' and y is a row coordinate from 'r01' to 'r10'. This action is legal only if the targeted cell is unoccupied, ensuring no overwriting of existing queen placements. If the player does not place a queen, the board state remains unchanged for that cell. Once a queen is placed on a cell, that cell's state updates to indicate the presence of the queen, and this placement influences the state through implicit automatic events, notably the attack calculations. The game defines adjacency relationships between rows and columns, which are used to determine legal queen moves and attacks; queens can attack cells along their row, column, and diagonals, including northeast and northwest directions, provided that these directions follow the adjacency and next-column relationships without jumping over other queens. A cell is considered attacked if it lies along a queen's line of attack, and if previously attacked, the number of times attacked increments accordingly. The game imposes implicit constraints that placements must remain within the board boundaries and that no cell may hold more than one queen. The progression of the game is controlled by a step counter that increments each turn, and the game ends automatically after step s11, marking the terminal condition. Scoring in the game is derived from the number of attacks on the board, where the value associated with attacks decreases with each successive step from 100 at s0, down incrementally to 0 at s8 and beyond; the player's goal is to maximize the number of attacks before the game terminates, with the final score reflecting the attack value mapped to the last step reached. No explicit noop (no operation) action is specified, but the player may choose to refrain from placing a queen on a turn, resulting in no change to the board state for that step.
