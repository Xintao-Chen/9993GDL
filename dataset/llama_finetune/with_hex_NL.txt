The game is played on a grid with rows labeled from 'a' to 'i' and columns numbered from 1 to 9, forming a 9-by-9 board where each position is identified by a row-column pair. The adjacency relations between cells are defined both orthogonally and diagonally, considering neighboring rows and columns. There are two players, red and blue, who alternate turns starting with red, as the initial control is set to red and the step counter starts at 1. On a player's turn, that player may place a piece of their color on any unoccupied cell of the board; a move placing a piece is legal only if it is that player's turn to move and the chosen cell is currently empty. The other player may perform a noop action, which is only legal when it is not their turn. After each move, the control switches to the opposing player, and the step counter increments by one. When a player places a piece, that cell becomes occupied by that player's color on the next state. Additionally, the game tracks ownership of certain connected components on the board, which are updated when a player places a piece adjacent to a cell belonging to their owned connected component, causing a transfer of ownership to the new position. The connected components are sets of cells connected through adjacency, and only those owned by a player can be expanded by placing pieces adjacent to them. The game ends when either player achieves a path condition: for red, this requires there to exist a connected component owned by red that includes at least one cell in the leftmost column (column 1, specifically row 'a') and one cell in the rightmost column (column 9, specifically row 'i'); for blue, the winning path condition is similar but involves connected components spanning from the top row (row 'a') to the bottom row (row 'i'). Upon reaching such a terminal state where a player's path condition is fulfilled, that player receives a goal value of 100, signifying victory, while the other player receives 0. Throughout gameplay, no piece can be placed outside the defined rows and columns, and no cell may be occupied by more than one piece. The game proceeds until one player forms the required connected path across the board, and the victory is determined solely by the fulfillment of these path conditions.
