The game is set within a three-dimensional grid environment composed of cells identified by four indices: the first two indices range over 1 to 3 and represent a higher-level subdivision of the board, while the last two indices also range over 1 to 3 and specify positions within these subdivisions, effectively creating a 3x3 grid of 3x3 subgrids, totaling 81 cells. Each cell can hold either a blank marker or a digit from 1 to 9. The single player role, named "robot," takes turns marking an empty cell with a digit. The initial state is defined by a partially filled grid where some cells contain digits while others are blank. On each turn, the robot may perform exactly one action of the form "mark i j k l x," where the indices i, j, k, and l identify a specific cell, and x is the digit to place in that cell. An action is legal only if the target cell is currently blank, and the digit x does not already appear in the same row (the cells with the same k and l indices across all i and j), the same column (cells with the same i and j indices but varying k and l), or the same 3x3 square identified by i and k indices in combination with the j index fixed to 1, 2, or 3, depending on the subdivision, enforcing Sudoku-like constraints within this complex structure. Each action updates the state by placing the digit x in the specified cell, replacing the blank marker. The game automatically detects whether any blank cells remain; if none remain, the game terminates and the robot receives a goal value of 100, indicating victory, otherwise the goal is 0 and play continues. The game ends when no legal moves are available, i.e., when no blank cells can be filled without violating the constraints. There is no explicit noop action since the robot must place a digit each turn if possible. The coordinate system, therefore, enforces a spatial and logical structure resembling Sudoku extended into a multi-layered 3x3 cell arrangement, with implicit constraints preventing duplicate digits within rows, columns, and these defined squares. The robot's objective is to fill all blank cells legally to complete the puzzle and maximize its score, achieving a perfect solution for a maximum reward.
