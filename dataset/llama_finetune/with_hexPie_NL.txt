The game is played on a grid defined by nine rows labeled from 'a' to 'i' and nine columns numbered from 1 to 9, forming a coordinate system where positions are specified by a row and column pair. There are two players, player1 and player2, who alternate turns beginning with player1. Each player uses a distinct marker color, with player1 initially using red and player2 blue. The initial state sets the control to player1, the step counter at 1, and allows player2 the option to swap markers once during the game. On a player's turn, if it is their control phase, they may place their marker on any unoccupied cell within the board's boundaries, meaning the cell must not already hold a red or blue marker, and the coordinates must be valid rows and columns. Player2 has an additional legal move option on their turn to swap marker colors with player1, but this can only be done once per game and only if the swap option remains available. When it is not a player's turn, they may legally perform a noop action, effectively passing. Executing a placement action updates the state by marking the chosen cell with the player's marker color and advances the step number. The control alternates each turn between the players. The game tracks connected cells of the same color, where a cell is considered connected to another if they are adjacent either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, as defined by neighboring rows and columns. Connections propagate through placed markers, and if a newly placed marker is adjacent to an existing connected group of the same color, the connection extends to include the new placement. The swap action changes the marker colors each player is using, swapping red and blue markers between the two players, and this also disables further swaps. The game terminates when a player achieves a winning path: for the red marker, this is a continuous connected path linking the top row 'a' to the bottom row 'i', and for the blue marker, a continuous connected path joining the leftmost column 1 to the rightmost column 9. The victory condition awards 100 points to the player whose marker color forms such a connecting path; if neither player meets this condition, the game is not terminal. The board boundaries implicitly restrict placements to the defined rows and columns, and occupancy rules prevent placing markers on already occupied cells. The alternating turn structure, the optional swap by player2, the adjacency rules for connectivity, and the terminal win conditions for continuous paths across the board define the strategic and procedural framework of the game.
