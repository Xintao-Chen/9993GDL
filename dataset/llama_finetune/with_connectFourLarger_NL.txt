The game is played on a two-dimensional board with coordinates defined by columns labeled 1 through 20 along the horizontal axis (x-axis) and rows labeled 1 through 20 along the vertical axis (y-axis). There are two players, red and black, who alternate turns beginning with the red player in control at the initial state. On a player's turn, they may either perform a drop action or choose to do nothing (noop). However, a noop is only legal for a player when it is the other player's turn to move, effectively preventing them from acting out of turn. The drop action involves placing a piece into one of the columns, specifically into the lowest unoccupied row within that column; this is only legal if the column is open, meaning the topmost cell (row 20) of that column is free. When a piece is dropped into an empty column, it occupies the bottom cell (row 1) of that column. If the column already contains pieces, the new piece occupies the next available cell directly above the highest occupied cell, ensuring stacking from bottom to top. Pieces cannot be placed outside the board boundaries or in occupied cells. After each move, the control switches to the opposing player. The game continues until a terminal condition is met, which occurs if either player forms a line of four consecutive pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or if the board is completely filled with no open columns remaining. Lines are defined as sequences of four adjacent cells in any of these directions occupied by the same player's pieces. Upon reaching a terminal state, the player who formed the line is awarded a full score of 100, the opposing player receives zero. If no lines are formed and the board is full, both players receive a score of 50, representing a draw. If the game ends prematurely with the board still open and no line formed, the player whose opponent formed a line gains zero, while the other player also receives zero, indicating an incomplete or ongoing game state. Thus, the game's objective is to strategically drop pieces into columns to create a four-in-a-row sequence before the opponent does or before the board becomes entirely filled.
