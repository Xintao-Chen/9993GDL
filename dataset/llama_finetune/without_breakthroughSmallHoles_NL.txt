The game is played on a grid with coordinates ranging from 1 to 6 for both the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) axes, establishing a two-dimensional board environment. There are two player roles: white and black, who alternate turns with white moving first, followed by black, and so forth. The initial setup places white pieces along the first and second rows (y = 1 and y = 2) covering all columns from 1 to 6, while black pieces occupy the fifth and sixth rows (y = 5 and y = 6) across all columns. Additionally, there are designated hole cells at positions (2,3), (3,4), (4,3), and (5,4) which are impassable and cannot be occupied by any piece. On a player's turn, they may perform a move action or a noop; the noop action is only legal for the player who does not currently have control, effectively passing the turn when the opponent is to move. Moves consist of relocating one of the player's pieces forward one row in the direction of the opponent's side, either directly forward in the same column or diagonally forward to an adjacent column, as long as the destination cell is within the board boundaries, is not occupied by any piece (friendly or enemy), and is not a hole cell. Specifically, white pieces move from lower to higher y-coordinates, advancing one row forward either vertically or diagonally left or right by one column, while black pieces move from higher to lower y-coordinates with similar lateral moves. The legality of a move requires the piece to currently occupy the starting cell and the destination cell to be unoccupied and free of holes. Executing a move updates the board state by relocating the piece from its original position to the new position, marking the starting cell as vacated and the destination cell as occupied by the moving player. Control switches to the opposing player after each move. The game ends under terminal conditions when either player achieves victory by having any of their pieces reach the opponent's home row â€” white wins if any white piece reaches y = 6, and black wins if any black piece reaches y = 1. Additionally, a player wins if it is the opponent's turn and that opponent has no legal moves available. The scoring reflects these outcomes, awarding 100 points to the winner and 0 points to the loser. Throughout the game, pieces cannot move onto or through hole cells, cannot move outside the 6x6 board, and cannot occupy the same cell simultaneously. These constraints ensure a clear progression toward victory by advancing pieces forward while avoiding obstacles and blocked paths.
