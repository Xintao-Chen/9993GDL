The game is played on a grid-based environment consisting of two overlapping boards: a smaller 3x3 tic-tac-toe board with coordinates ranging from 1 to 3 on both axes, and a larger 4x4 board also indexed from 1 to 4 on both axes. There are two players, named "xcplayer" and "obplayer," who alternate turns in a strict sequence, starting with "xcplayer" as indicated by the initial control state. Each cell on both boards can be in one of several states: blank (denoted by "b"), marked by "x" (associated with "xcplayer"), or marked by "o" (associated with "obplayer"). Initially, all cells in the 3x3 board are blank, and control is assigned to "xcplayer." On their turn, a player may perform one of two types of actions: they can either mark an unoccupied blank cell on the board corresponding to their role or choose a noop (no-operation) action when it is not their turn and the current tic is not finished. Marking a cell is only legal if the chosen cell is blank and the player currently has control; noop actions are legal only for the player who does not currently have control and when the tic is unfinished. Once a move is made, the cell's state updates to reflect the player's mark, and control passes to the other player. A reset action is also available but only when a tic is finished and no tic score has yet been recorded. The game detects lines of three identical marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the 3x3 board, which constitutes a finished tic. Scores for each player in a tic are assigned as 50 points for a winning line, 25 points for a draw (no lines for either player and no open cells), and 0 points for losing lines. The tic scores accumulate over the course of the game. On the larger 4x4 board, a "bridge" is defined as a contiguous chain of four "xcplayer" marks connected through predefined adjacent coordinates, forming a specific pattern across rows and columns. The presence or absence of this bridge affects the scoring for the block phase; if the bridge exists, "xcplayer" scores 50 points and "obplayer" scores 0, otherwise the scores are reversed. The game ends when both a tic score has been recorded (indicating the tic is finished) and the block phase is finished, which occurs either when the bridge is established or when no blank cells remain on the 4x4 board. At termination, each player's final score is the sum of their accumulated tic scores and their block phase score. The player with the higher total score is the winner. Implicit constraints include the bounded coordinate systems for rows and columns on both boards, the exclusivity of cell occupancy (a cell cannot be marked more than once), and the alternation of control ensuring proper turn-taking. No moves are legal on occupied cells or out-of-bounds coordinates. The game thus combines a classic tic-tac-toe mechanic with an overlaying strategic placement on a larger grid, culminating in a composite scoring system that rewards success in both phases.
