The game is played on a 7-by-7 grid where coordinates are indexed from 1 to 7 both horizontally and vertically. Four players take part in the game, each assigned a distinct role named red, yellow, blue, and green, and they take turns in a fixed rotational order: red moves first, followed by yellow, then blue, and finally green, after which the cycle repeats. The initial setup places a single piece for each player at specific coordinates: red's piece starts at (1,4), yellow's at (4,1), blue's at (7,4), and green's at (4,7). The game begins with red in control and the turn counter set to one. During a player's turn, if they have any legal moves, they must make exactly one; if no legal moves are available, the player may perform a noop action, effectively passing their turn. A move action is specified by four coordinates: the starting cell (x1, y1) and the destination cell (x2, y2), representing moving one piece from the former to the latter. Moves are legal only if the player controls a piece at the starting cell, it is their turn, and the destination cell is reachable via certain defined movement patterns. Specifically, a piece can move to an orthogonally or diagonally adjacent cell if it is occupied by an opponent's piece, provided that the destination is not on the outermost rows or columns (i.e., neither x nor y equals 1 or 7). Alternatively, a piece can move in an "ell" shape—defined as moving two spaces in one direction and one space perpendicular to that—onto an empty cell that is also not on the border of the board. Moves cannot land on the board's edges, and a player cannot move onto a cell occupied by their own piece. When a move is made onto a cell occupied by an opponent's piece, that piece is captured and removed from play, decreasing the opponent's piece count, while the moving player maintains or increases their piece count if they spawn a new piece at the starting position. The turn control passes to the next player according to the rotation sequence after each move. The step counter increments by one every turn. The game ends either when any player forms a line of three of their pieces in a row, column, or diagonal within the central 3-by-3 area defined by coordinates 3 to 5 in both axes, or when the step counter reaches 33, whichever occurs first. Victory is awarded fully with a score of 100 points to any player who achieves such a line. If the game ends without any player forming a line, the score for each player is based on the number of pieces they have remaining on the board, mapped to a value with 1 piece worth 10 points, 2 pieces 20 points, and so forth, up to a maximum of 99 points for 10 or more pieces. Overall, players strategically maneuver their single pieces around the board avoiding edges, capturing opponent pieces by moving orthogonally or diagonally onto them, or moving in "ell" shaped patterns to empty cells, aiming to create a three-in-a-row in the central grid or to outlast others by maintaining the greatest number of pieces by the end of the 33rd step, with the turn order strictly cycling through red, yellow, blue, and green.
