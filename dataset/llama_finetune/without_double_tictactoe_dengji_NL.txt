This game is played on two separate 3-by-3 grids, each with cells identified by coordinates (m, n) where both m and n range from 1 to 3. The coordinate system labels rows from 1 to 3 and columns from 1 to 3 in each grid. Two players, named xplayer and oplayer, alternate turns, with xplayer starting first as indicated by the initial control. On each turn, the player in control can legally place their mark on any unoccupied cell (denoted by 'b' for blank) on the grid they are allowed to mark on during that turn. Specifically, xplayer marks cells on the first grid using the action mark1, and oplayer marks cells on the first grid similarly; on the subsequent grid, xplayer uses mark2 and oplayer does likewise, alternating control after each move. A player’s move consists of specifying the coordinates of the cell they wish to mark, and it is only legal if the cell is currently blank, it is that player’s turn, and the game is not in a terminal state. If it is not a player's turn, the only legal action they may take is noop, effectively passing control to the other player without changing the board state. After a player marks a cell, that cell's state updates to that player’s symbol (x or o) on the relevant grid, while all other cells retain their previous state. The control alternates strictly between xplayer and oplayer after each move. The game tracks winning conditions by checking for any full row, column, or diagonal of identical marks on either grid. Terminal conditions are met if either player has completed such a line on the first grid (terminal1) or the second grid (terminal2), or if there are no blank cells remaining on the first grid (no open1) or the second grid (no open2), combined with the absence of winning lines. Scoring depends on the presence or absence of winning lines on both boards and whether open cells remain, with players receiving values of 0, 25, 50, 75, or 100 points based on complex conditions comparing lines of x and o on both grids and the availability of moves. These scores determine the winner. Implicit constraints ensure moves must be within the 3x3 grid boundaries, cells cannot be occupied more than once, and players cannot place marks out of turn or on already occupied cells. The game ends when a player achieves a winning line on either board or when no further moves can be made on the boards without a winner, at which point the final scores adjudicate victory.
