The game is played on an 8-by-8 board using a coordinate system where both the x and y coordinates range from 1 to 8. There are two players, white and black, who alternate turns with white moving first. Initially, each player places three pieces of their color—specifically knights and pawns—on predetermined rows: white pieces occupy rows 1 and 2, while black pieces occupy rows 7 and 8. This placement phase occurs only on the first step, governed by a step counter initialized to 1. During this initial step, each player’s legal move is to place three of their own pieces simultaneously in their respective starting rows. After this setup, the step counter increments and normal play begins. In normal turns, players alternate control, with white moving first, then black, and so forth, as indicated by a control predicate switching between them each turn. Each turn, a player may either perform a move action or, if allowed, a noop (no operation) action; white may perform noop only when it is black’s turn, and black may perform noop only after the initial placement step has passed and it is white’s turn, thus preventing a skip of moves before the game properly starts. Moves consist of moving a single piece from one cell to another and must be legal according to the piece’s movement rules and occupancy constraints. Specifically, a piece can move only if it belongs to the player controlling the turn, the source cell contains that piece, and the destination cell is either empty or occupied by an opponent’s piece, but never by a piece of the same color. Movement rules vary by piece type: pawns move forward one cell or diagonally forward by one cell, with the exact direction depending on color (white pawns move upward in y, black pawns downward), and knights move in an “L” shape consistent with chess knight moves, again adjusted for player color and direction. After a move, the piece vacates its original cell and occupies the new cell, while all other cells remain unchanged unless specifically moved. The step counter automatically increments each turn, tracking the number of turns elapsed. The game imposes implicit constraints including the 8x8 board boundary, ensuring coordinates remain within index 1 through 8, and that no two pieces of the same color occupy the same cell. Terminal conditions arise in three ways: if white has any piece on the eighth row (y=8), white wins; if black has any piece on the first row (y=1), black wins; or when 60 steps have passed, the game ends. Additionally, if after the initial placement step has passed there are no white pieces on the board, black wins; similarly, if no black pieces remain, white wins. Victory is binary: the winning player receives a score of 100, and the losing player receives 0. Thus, the objective is to advance one’s pieces to the opponent’s home row or eliminate all opponent pieces after the initial placement, within the 60-turn limit, while abiding by movement and placement rules on an 8x8 grid.
