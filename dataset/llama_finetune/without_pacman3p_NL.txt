The game is set on a grid-based board defined by coordinates ranging from 1 to 8 for both x and y axes, with each cell identified by its (x, y) position. The environment includes specific pellet locations scattered throughout the grid and certain blocked passages that prevent movement north or east between adjacent cells, effectively creating walls. The game features three player roles: Pacman, Blinky, and Inky, with turns alternating between Pacman and the ghosts collectively (Blinky and Inky). Initially, Pacman is controlled first and begins at position (5,3), while Blinky and Inky start at positions (4,6) and (5,6) respectively. On each turn, the player in control may choose to move in one of the four directions—north, south, east, or west—or opt for a noop move (move nowhere) if it is not their turn to act, ensuring turn-based control is respected. Moves are legal only if the destination cell is within the board boundaries, not blocked by walls, and adjacent to the current position in the chosen direction; no moves onto occupied cells by other characters are explicitly forbidden but ghosts and Pacman can occupy the same cell, which triggers capture. When Pacman moves onto a cell containing a pellet, that pellet is collected and removed from the board, incrementing the collected count; if there is no pellet in the destination cell, the collected count remains the same. The control alternates each turn between Pacman and the ghosts, ensuring a strict turn order. The game terminates if Pacman is captured by either Blinky or Inky occupying the same cell, if all pellets have been collected (35 pellets total), or if 100 steps have elapsed. Scoring for Pacman is based on the number of pellets collected, mapped to a score scale where collecting all 35 pellets yields a maximum score of 100. The ghosts score zero if they fail to capture Pacman and 100 if they succeed in capturing him. Movement legality is carefully determined by adjacency, absence of blocking walls, and board boundaries, with special rules preventing movement through walls or outside the grid. Overall, the game combines strategic movement on a constrained grid with turn-based control, pellet collection, and capture mechanics to determine victory conditions and scoring.
