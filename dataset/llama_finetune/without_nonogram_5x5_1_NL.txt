The game is set on a 5-by-5 grid with coordinates defined by integers from 1 to 5 along both rows and columns, where each cell can be referenced by a column-row pair within this bounded index range. There is a single player role called "robot," who takes all turns sequentially. Initially, no cells on the board are marked. On each turn, the robot may choose to mark exactly one unmarked cell by specifying its column and row coordinates, with the action represented as (mark ?col ?row). This marking action is legal only if the chosen coordinates are within the grid boundaries and the cell is currently unmarked. If no legal markings are available or desired, the robot may effectively perform a no-operation by not marking any cell. Each action updates the game state by marking the chosen cell while preserving all previously marked cells. The game enforces implicit constraints such that marked groups of contiguous cells in any row or column must correspond to predefined group sizes specified for that row or column; these groups are sequences of marked cells separated by unmarked cells or board edges. The game automatically computes and tracks these contiguous marked groups along rows and columns, ensuring that the number and size of these groups match the allowed patterns. The game terminates when either a row or column has a marked group exceeding the allowed size or when the count of marked groups in a row or column differs from the expected group count, or when all rows and columns satisfy their group size and count constraints perfectly. Victory is achieved if, upon termination, none of the rows or columns violate these group size or count conditions, awarding the robot a score of 100; otherwise, the score is zero. Thus, the robot must mark cells to form continuous groups that comply precisely with the given row and column group specifications, avoiding marking patterns that create groups too large or too few or too many groups than allowed, within the fixed 5x5 grid environment.
