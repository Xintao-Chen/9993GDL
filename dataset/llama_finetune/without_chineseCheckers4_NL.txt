The game is played on a uniquely shaped board composed of multiple labeled cells arranged in rows and columns with indices ranging from a1 to i1, including intermediate cells such as b1, c3, d4, and so on, with certain cells designated as reserved. The coordinate system uses these alphanumeric indices to identify individual cells. There are four players in the game, each associated with a distinct role and color: yellow, green, blue, and magenta. The players take turns in a fixed cyclical order starting with yellow, followed by green, then blue, and finally magenta, after which the cycle repeats. Initially, the board is populated with each player's stones placed on specific cells: red stones occupy a1, b1, and b2; magenta stones occupy c1, c2, and d1; yellow stones are on c6, c7, and d6; blue stones are at f1, g1, and g2; green stones occupy f6, g6, and g7; and teal stones are on h1, h2, and i1. The yellow player begins in control, and the game step count starts at one.

On a player's turn, they may perform exactly one action which can be either a move or a noop (no operation). A move action involves specifying a starting cell containing one of the player's stones and a destination cell to which the stone will be moved. Moves are legal only when the player has control and the move satisfies certain adjacency and occupancy rules defined by directional relationships called "car" and "cdr," which depend on the player's role and the connectivity between cells. In particular, moves require traversing through a chain of occupied and empty cells following these directional relationships, ensuring that stones move along valid paths without violating board boundaries or overlapping other stones. If a player has no legal move available or it is not their turn, they may perform a noop action to pass. After a move, the stone is transferred from the starting cell to the destination cell, and the starting cell becomes unoccupied. The control passes to the next player in the turn order after every move or noop.

The game employs implicit constraints such as the requirement that moves must follow specific directional car and cdr relationships between cells linked by paths defined for each playerâ€™s color, and stones cannot move onto occupied cells. The board's boundaries and reserved cells restrict movement and initial placement. Automatic events include updating the control to the next player and incrementing the step count after each turn. The game terminates either after 60 steps have been completed or if two players simultaneously achieve a condition where all their respective target stones occupy their designated cells.

Victory and scoring criteria depend on how many of a player's stones occupy their designated target cells, which are grouped into sets of three specific cells for each player color, such as f1, g1, and g2 for yellow, or c1, c2, and d1 for green. If a player occupies all three target cells, they are considered to have all stones in place; occupying two is considered some stones; one stone; and none if they occupy no target cells. The player who first achieves having all stones in place is considered the first and awarded maximum points. After the first player is determined, other players receive points according to whether they have all, some, one, or no stones in their target cells, with a descending point scale from 100 down to zero. If the game ends after 60 steps without a first player being determined, players receive points similarly based on how many of their stones occupy target cells at that time. The game thus rewards players for occupying their target cells and finishing first, with points assigned accordingly.
