The game is played between two players called north and south on a circular arrangement of twelve normal pits labeled p1 through p12, each owned by one of the players, with pits p1 to p6 owned by south and p7 to p12 owned by north. In addition to these, there are two scoring pits named pwinnorth and pwinsouth, associated respectively with the north and south players. The pits are organized in a ring where each pit has a designated next pit that cycles through all pits and scoring pits, creating a continuous loop. The initial state places four stones in each normal pit and zero stones in the scoring pits, and the north player has the initial control of the game. Players alternate turns, starting with north, with turn control passing in specific ways depending on the actions taken. On a player's turn, if it is not that player's turn, they may perform a noop action, which is legal whenever the other player has control, or if it is their turn but all their pits are empty and their hand is empty. If it is their turn, the player may perform one of three types of actions: picking up stones from one of their own non-empty pits, putting stones into a pit when holding stones in hand, or clearing stones from a scoring pit under certain conditions. The pick action is legal only if the player has control, their hand is empty, the chosen pit belongs to them and is not a scoring pit, and the opponent has some stones; the put action requires the player to have control, have stones in hand, and place stones into the current pit held in hand; the clear action is permitted when the player has control, the pit is owned by them but not a scoring pit, the opponent's pits are all empty, and the playerâ€™s hand is empty. The hand tracks the number of stones a player currently holds, starting empty. Upon picking stones from a pit, the stones are removed from that pit and stored in the player's hand, and the position at which the player is at updates to the next pit in the sequence. When putting stones, one stone is deposited into the current pit, increasing its count by one and decreasing the hand count, with a special rule if the last put stone empties the pit and it is a scoring pit, stones from the opposite pit are captured and added to the scoring pit. Clearing a pit sets its stone count to zero, and if the pit is a scoring pit, it adds stones from another pit as well. The game enforces constraints such as pits must belong to the acting player when picking or clearing, pits cannot be scoring pits for picks and clears except when specified, and the circular order of pits is preserved. The game ends when all pits owned by either player are empty, at which point the goals are calculated by mapping the number of stones in each player's scoring pit to a score, using a predefined mapping that associates stone counts with numerical values. The player with the higher score in their scoring pit wins. Throughout the game, the control passes between players according to the rules defined by the actions taken, with specific conditions governing when control switches or remains, and legal noop actions allow a player to pass their turn when appropriate. The coordinate system is effectively the circular ordering of pits, with each pit's successor defined to create a loop, and the concept of opposite pits pairs pits across the board for capturing mechanics. The game therefore consists of strategic pit selection, stone sowing, capturing, and scoring, played until one side has no stones left on their side of the board, resulting in a final scoring comparison to determine the winner.
