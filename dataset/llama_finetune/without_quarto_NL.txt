This game is played on a 4-by-4 grid with coordinates ranging from 1 to 4 on both the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) axes. Two players participate, designated as white and black, who alternate turns in a fixed sequence starting with white. The initial state of the board has all cells empty, and all pieces—sixteen distinct pieces identified by unique bit patterns—are available in a shared pool. On each turn, a player first selects one piece from the pool that has not been chosen or placed yet; this selection phase is controlled by the player with selectControl, initially assigned to white. Once a piece is selected, the same player proceeds to place the selected piece onto any empty cell on the board during the placeControl phase. Actions must adhere to strict legality conditions: a player may only select a piece if it is still in the pool and it is their turn to select, and may only place a piece if they have selected it and the target cell is empty. Noop actions are available but only when the player has neither selection nor placement control, effectively serving as a pass or wait mechanism outside of active phases. After a piece is placed, it is removed from the pool and the cell state updates to reflect the piece's presence, while all other cell states remain unchanged. The turn control alternates between players, moving from white's select phase to white's place phase, then to black's select phase, black's place phase, and back to white's select phase, and so forth. The game terminates when a winning line is formed or when no empty cells remain on the board. A winning line consists of four pieces aligned horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, all sharing a common bit value in at least one bit position, meaning that for some bit index, all four pieces in the line have the same bit set or unset. The line formation check occurs for every row, column, and both diagonals. Scoring is based on who placed the last piece and whether a line exists: the player who creates the line receives 100 points, the other player receives zero. If the board is full without a line, both players receive 50 points. If the board is not full and no line exists, both players receive zero points. Implicit constraints include the board boundaries limiting placement to coordinates from 1 to 4 in both directions, each cell can hold only one piece, and pieces once placed cannot be moved again. The game thus requires players to strategically select and place pieces to create a line of four pieces sharing a specific bit characteristic before the board fills up.
