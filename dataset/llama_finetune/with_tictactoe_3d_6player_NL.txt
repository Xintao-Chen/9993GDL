This game is played on a three-dimensional grid defined by coordinates labeled as rows, columns, and levels, each ranging from 1 to 4, creating a 4x4x4 board. The environment consists of cells identified by this triplet coordinate system, and each cell can hold a marker or remain blank. Two teams, X and O, each comprised of three distinct player roles—row, column, and level—take turns in a fixed cyclic order within their respective teams: for team X, the order is xrow, then xcolumn, then xlevel, and for team O, it is orow, then ocolumn, then olevel. The game initializes with all cells empty and the control assigned to the xrow role, with the first roles for each team recorded accordingly. On a player's turn, they may select a coordinate value corresponding to their assigned role: xrow and orow select a row number, xcolumn and ocolumn select a column number, and xlevel and olevel select a level number. A legal action consists of a selection of a coordinate value within the range of 1 to 4, provided the chosen cell at the intersection of the currently selected row, column, and level is unoccupied (blank), ensuring no overlapping pieces. If it is not a player's turn, their only legal action is to perform a no-operation (noop), effectively passing. When a player selects a coordinate value, the game updates that coordinate for their role, and if the selected cell defined by the current row, column, and level selections is blank, the cell is marked with the player's team symbol (X or O). After a successful placement, the turn passes to the next role in the cyclic order, and the game state reflects the updated board and current control. The game imposes implicit constraints such as board boundaries (coordinates must be between 1 and 4), exclusivity of cell occupation, and the necessity that selections correspond to the current player's role. The game terminates when a player forms a line of four of their symbols in a row, column, level, or any straight line along any direction in the three-dimensional grid, or when no blank cells remain on the board, indicating a full board. Victory is awarded to the player who achieves a line of four symbols, granting them a score of 100. If no such line exists and the board is full, both players receive a score of 50. Conversely, if a player’s opponent has formed a line, the player receives zero points. Thus, the objective is to strategically select coordinates on one's turn to place markers and create a straight line of four in the 4x4x4 grid before the opponent does or before the board fills up.
