The game is played between two players designated as white and black, with a maximum of 20 rounds defining the length of the game. The environment is abstract and does not specify a spatial coordinate system; instead, the focus is on scoring and turn progression. The game begins with both players' scores initialized to zero and the round counter set to zero. Players alternate turns, each choosing an action from one of two possible directions: left or right. On each turn, a player must select a legal direction, provided the current round number has not reached the maximum limit of 20 rounds; if the maximum round is reached, no further moves are legal, and the game terminates. Actions are represented simply by the player's choice of direction, and for an action to be legal, the player must be either white or black, and the chosen direction must be one of the two allowed directions. After both players have made their moves in a round, the round counter increments by one. The scoring mechanism depends on the combined choices of both players each round: if both players select the same direction, the score of each player increases by five points; if their directions differ, scores remain unchanged. There are implicit constraints ensuring that no moves are legal once the maximum round count is reached, effectively bounding the game's duration. The game ends when the round count reaches 20, at which point the final scores determine each player's goal value, which corresponds directly to their accumulated scores. The gameâ€™s objective is to maximize the individual player's score accumulated over the rounds, with the final score reflecting the player's success. There is no explicit mention of a "noop" or no-operation action, so players must always select either left or right on their turn until the game ends. Overall, the game involves straightforward turn-taking, direction selection, and score accumulation over a fixed number of rounds, with termination occurring strictly at round 20 and victory determined by the final scores achieved.
