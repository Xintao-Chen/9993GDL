The game is played on a complex multi-level board represented by four coordinates, each ranging from 1 to 3, establishing a hierarchical three-by-three grid system within a three-by-three grid, effectively creating sub-boards within a larger board. There are two players, named xPlayer and oPlayer, who alternate turns starting with xPlayer initially in control. On a player's turn, they may either perform a move or pass by executing a noop action, but a noop is only legal when it is the other player's turn to act, enforcing strict turn-taking discipline. Each move consists of placing the player's mark, either an 'x' or an 'o', into an empty cell specified by the four coordinates, which must be unoccupied by any mark; moves are constrained to cells that are within the current sub-board in play or, if the current sub-board is closed (fully occupied), any empty cell on the board. The first move of the game is restricted to any empty cell since no current sub-board is designated at the start. When a player places a mark at coordinates (i, j, k, l), this cell becomes marked with their symbol, and the current sub-board updates to the smaller board indexed by (k, l), determining the next active sub-board for the opponent's move. The game enforces that moves cannot be made outside of the designated sub-board unless it is closed, preventing placement in full sub-boards. The game ends when there is a line of three marks belonging to the same player in any row, column, or diagonal on any of the sub-boards or when no empty cells remain, signifying a fully occupied board with no winner. A line is defined as three consecutive marks of the same player either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally within a sub-board or the overarching board structure. Scoring assigns 100 points to a player who achieves such a line, 0 points to the opponent, and 50 points to both players if the board is full with no winner, representing a draw. The game state progresses by switching control to the other player after each move. Implicit constraints include the boundaries that limit indices to the set {1, 2, 3} for each coordinate, the prohibition of marking already occupied cells, and the requirement that moves adhere to the current sub-board unless it is closed. Throughout, the system maintains the marks placed on the board and tracks the current sub-board for the following move, effectively creating a layered Tic-Tac-Toe variant with nested boards and strategic sub-board targeting.
