The game is played on a grid defined by rows labeled r1 through r5 and columns labeled c1 through c5, with neighboring rows and columns established to form a coordinate system where adjacency is defined by immediate succession in rows and columns. Two players, named 'x' and 'o', alternate turns with player 'x' starting the game as indicated by the initial control state. Each player begins with eight quads and zero white tokens. The board cells are initialized as empty (denoted by 'b') in the specified grid locations. On a player's turn, they may perform one of two legal actions if it is their control: either mark a cell that is currently blank, or block a cell that is blank provided that the player has at least one white token available. Marking a cell changes that cell's state to the current player's marker, while blocking changes it to a white token, consuming one white token from the player. If it is not a player's turn, their only legal action is a no-operation (noop). After each action, control typically passes to the other player following a mark action, but remains with the same player after a block action. The board state updates accordingly, maintaining that cells can only be marked or blocked if they are blank, and the grid boundaries restrict positions to the specified rows and columns. The game detects terminal conditions when one player has formed a square of four of their marks anywhere on the board, resulting in a win for that player and a loss for the opponent. Additionally, the game ends if no open positions remain. A special win condition, called winByOpenQuad, occurs when one player has three markers in a square with one blank cell, provided the opponent has no winning squares and the game is not open; this influences scoring but does not immediately end the game. Scoring is based on these conditions: a win yields 100 points, a winByOpenQuad yields 95 for player x and 5 for player o, while other outcomes depend on the comparative number of white tokens each player holds, with more white tokens providing a higher score when no wins or open quads exist. The opponent's score is complementary, with losses scoring zero points. The game proceeds until a terminal condition—win, lose, or no open moves—is met, at which point the final goal values determine the winner.
