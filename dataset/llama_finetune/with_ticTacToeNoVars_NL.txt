The game is played on a 3-by-3 grid with rows and columns indexed from 1 to 3, establishing a coordinate system where each cell is identified by a pair of indices (row, column). There are two players, named xPlayer and oPlayer, who alternate turns starting with xPlayer. At the beginning, the control is assigned to xPlayer, and the board is empty with no marks placed. On a player’s turn, if they have control, they may place their respective mark—'x' for xPlayer and 'o' for oPlayer—in any empty cell; a cell is considered empty if it has not been marked previously by either player. Alternatively, the player without control may perform a noop action, which essentially passes the turn without making a move. Actions are legal only if the acting player currently has control and the targeted cell for placement is empty; noop actions are only legal for the player who does not have control at that moment. When a player places their mark in a cell, the game state updates to reflect this new mark on the board, and control passes to the other player. If a player does not place a mark, the control still switches accordingly. The game enforces implicit constraints such that marks cannot be placed outside the 3x3 grid or on already occupied cells, and only one mark can occupy each cell at any time. The game reaches a terminal state under three conditions: when either player forms a winning line of three marks in a row, column, or diagonal; or when there are no empty cells remaining and no winning line has been formed, resulting in a draw. A winning line is defined as three identical marks aligned horizontally, vertically, or diagonally across the grid. Scoring reflects these conditions: a player receives 100 points if they have formed a winning line, 50 points if the game ends in a draw (no lines and no empty spaces), and 0 points if the opponent forms a winning line or if the game ends prematurely with empty spaces but no line. Thus, the game's objective is for each player to strategically place their marks to create a line of three while preventing the opponent from doing so, with turns alternating between players and moves constrained to empty cells within the 3x3 board.
