The game takes place on a hexagonal-like grid with coordinates labeled from a1 to g7, arranged in rows and columns with specific adjacency relations defined between cells horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. There is a single player role named "robot," who takes turns alone in the game. The initial state sets various cells on the board as either blank or containing numbered tokens, with some cells filled with specific numbers such as 37 at a2, 17 at c3, and so forth, while other cells start blank. On each turn, the robot may either place a new numbered token onto a blank cell or choose to quit, effectively ending the game. The placement action must specify a target cell and a number to place; this action is legal only if the cell is currently blank, the number is unused on the board, and the number is flanked by adjacent or absent numbers in the numeric sequenceâ€”specifically, the chosen number must be adjacent in value to other numbers already on or near the target cell or to numbers absent from the board but adjacent to the cell. The robot can also opt to quit, which triggers the finished state. When the robot places a number, the game state updates by marking that cell with the new number and marking the number as used; cells not targeted by the placement remain unchanged. If the robot quits, the finished state becomes true, and the game ends. The game also ends automatically when the board is completely filled with no blank cells remaining. Throughout play, the robot cannot place numbers outside the bounds of defined coordinates, must respect adjacency constraints both spatially on the board and numerically between numbers, and cannot place a number on an occupied cell. The terminal conditions are met either when the board is completely filled with numbers or when the robot chooses to quit, signaling the game's conclusion. Scoring is binary: if any blank cells remain when the game ends, the robot scores zero; if the board is fully filled with no blanks, the robot scores 100, indicating victory. Thus, the robot's objective is to fill the board with a sequence of numbers placed according to adjacency and numeric succession rules before quitting or before the board fills entirely, achieving a perfect filling for maximum score.
