The game takes place on a grid defined by rows labeled r1 through r7 and columns labeled c1 through c9, forming a 7-by-9 coordinate system where each cell is identified by a column-row pair such as c6 r4. The environment includes various cell types: blank spaces (denoted as b), walls, points, and an exit cell. The snake player is the sole participant and takes turns exclusively. Initially, multiple cells are set with specific contents including walls, points, blank spaces, and one exit cell, and the snake’s head and tail positions both start at cell c6 r4 with zero points and step count zero. On each turn, the snake may legally move one cell in one of four directions—up, down, left, or right—provided the destination cell is either blank, a point, or the exit, thus preventing movement onto walls or outside the board boundaries. Moves are encoded as actions specifying the direction of movement, and the game enforces that only moves into permissible adjacent cells are legal. The snake's position updates to the new cell after a move, and the tail position updates alternately on even moves, effectively simulating the snake's body movement by clearing the tail cell if it no longer occupies it. Collecting a point cell triggers an automatic score increment, with points scored increasing from 0 up to a maximum of 100 according to a predefined scale depending on the number of points collected. The environment prohibits overlapping occupancy by the snake and walls, and all movements must remain within the grid. The game terminates if the snake reaches the exit cell, if fifty steps have been taken, or if no legal moves remain for the snake. Victory or scoring is determined by the number of points collected upon exiting; if the snake reaches the exit, the final score corresponds to the points collected, otherwise a score of zero is awarded. Thus, the player controls the snake to navigate the grid, avoid walls, collect points, and reach the exit within a limited number of steps while maximizing their score.
