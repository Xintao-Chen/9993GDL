The game is played on a 10-by-10 grid with coordinates running from 1 to 10 along both the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) axes, forming a square board where each cell can be identified by a pair of indices (x, y). Two players participate, designated as white and black, who alternate turns in a fixed order starting with white. Initially, four white pieces occupy cells at coordinates (1,4), (4,1), (7,1), and (10,4), while four black pieces are placed at (1,7), (4,10), (7,10), and (10,7). The game proceeds in a cycle of two phases per player: a move phase followed by a fire phase. On a player's move phase, they may either move one of their pieces or choose to take no action (noop) if it is currently their opponent’s turn to move. Similarly, during the fire phase, a player may fire an arrow or opt for noop when it is the opponent’s fire phase. Moves involve relocating a piece from one occupied cell to another unoccupied cell along an open, unobstructed path in one of eight possible directions—north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, or northwest. The path must be continuous and free from obstacles, with adjacency defined by moving to the next index in the specified direction; multiple sequential steps along the same direction are permitted as long as no intervening cells are occupied. The fire action involves shooting an arrow from the piece's current position (just moved in the preceding move phase) along a similarly unobstructed path to an unoccupied target cell, which then becomes marked with an arrow, effectively blocking it for future moves or fires. Occupied cells include those containing any player’s piece or arrows. After a move, the piece vacates its original cell and occupies the new cell, while the fired arrow occupies its target cell. Turns alternate between move and fire phases within the same player and then switch to the opponent. The game terminates when the player whose turn it is to move has no legal moves available, signaling the end of the game. Victory is determined by the presence or absence of legal moves: the player who can still move when the opponent cannot is awarded a score of 100, while the player with no legal moves receives a score of 0. This scoring reflects the win-loss outcome, with no intermediate scoring. Implicit constraints include the board boundaries limiting coordinates to between 1 and 10, the inability to move or fire through or onto occupied cells, and the necessity for moves and fires to follow valid directional paths defined by the adjacency relations between indices. The game thus involves strategic movement and firing to control space, block opponent pieces, and ultimately restrict the opponent’s mobility to achieve victory.
