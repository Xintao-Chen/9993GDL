The game is played on two parallel lanes, designated as "wlane" and "blane," each consisting of a grid with rows labeled from 'a' to 'e' and columns numbered 1 through 3, forming a coordinate system where positions are identified by a lane, row, and column. Two players, named white and black, participate, with white associated with the "wlane" and black with the "blane," and turns alternate between these players in the order of white followed by black. The initial setup places a white pawn on the cell at lane wlane, row a, column 3, and a black pawn on lane blane, row a, column 3, with all other cells initially empty, represented by 'b.' Additionally, each lane has wall slots labeled by rows 'a' through 'd' initially set to 'none,' indicating no walls are placed, and each player starts with four walls available to place. The game state includes a step counter initialized to zero, incrementing by one each turn. On a player's turn, they may perform one of two legal actions: either move their pawn or place a wall on their opponent's lane. A move action consists of moving the player's pawn from its current cell to an adjacent cell within the same lane, following specific pawn movement rules that allow vertical and horizontal moves constrained by existing walls and the board's boundaries; the destination cell must be unoccupied. The pawn may move forward or sideways within the same row or move to the next row depending on the presence or absence of walls at certain positions. When a pawn moves, its previous cell becomes empty, and the new cell is occupied by the pawn. A place action involves placing one of the player's remaining walls on a wall slot in the opponent's lane on a specific row and side (left or right), provided that the player has at least one wall left to place and that the wall slot is currently empty. Placing a wall decreases the player's available walls by one and marks the opponent's lane wall slot as occupied on the chosen side, which influences the opponent's pawn movement by blocking certain moves. The game enforces implicit constraints, such as the lanes being fixed to five rows and three columns, pawns cannot move outside these boundaries, walls can only be placed on specific available slots in the opponent's lane, and pawns cannot move into occupied cells. The game terminates either when the step counter reaches 20 or when a pawn reaches the end row 'e' of either lane. Victory conditions hinge on the positions of the pawns and the number of walls remaining: a player wins with a score of 100 if their pawn reaches the end row 'e' in their lane while the opponent's pawn is not in the end row, or if both pawns are in the end row but the player has placed more walls than the opponent. If both pawns occupy the end row and both players have placed the same number of walls, the game results in a draw with a score of 50 for both players. If a player's pawn has not reached the end row by the time the maximum step count is reached, the game is also a draw. No-op moves are not explicitly defined, so each turn requires an action either to move or place a wall. This structure ensures strategic placement of walls to impede the opponent while advancing one's own pawn towards the goal, with the game progressing through alternating turns until terminal conditions are met and the winner is determined accordingly.
