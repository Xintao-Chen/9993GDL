The game takes place on a board arranged as a grid with seven rows labeled from r1 to r7 and nine columns labeled from c1 to c9, where rows and columns wrap around cyclically. Each cell on the board can be in one of several states such as blank (b), wall, point, or exit, with initial placements predefined for each cell. There is a single player role called "snake" who controls the movement of the snake on the board. The game begins with the snake positioned at cell c6 r4, which is also the initial tail position, and the player's score starting at zero points. Turns proceed sequentially with the snake making a move each step, up to a maximum of 50 steps; if no legal move exists or the snake reaches an exit cell, the game ends. On each turn, the snake must choose a move direction from up, down, left, or right, represented by actions that move the snake's head to an adjacent cell in the specified direction, provided that the destination cell is either blank, contains a point, or is the exit, and is not occupied by a wall or otherwise impassable terrain. The coordinate system enforces adjacency by defining "next cells" for each direction, ensuring moves wrap around the board edges due to the cyclic nature of rows and columns. When a move is executed, the snake's head advances to the new cell, and the tail position updates accordingly every other move, effectively simulating the snake's movement and growth. If the snake moves onto a point cell, the points counter increments by one, and the previous position of the tail becomes blank on even moves. The state transitions are governed by whether the current move count is even or odd, toggling tail movement and cell state changes appropriately. The snake cannot move into walls or outside the board, and it must avoid positions already occupied by its body except the tail under specific conditions. The game terminates if the snake reaches an exit cell, if 50 steps have elapsed, or if there are no legal moves available. The player's score upon termination depends on the number of points collected and whether the snake is on an exit cell, with a predefined scoring table mapping points to scores; reaching the exit yields a higher score than not doing so with the same number of points. Thus, the objective is to maneuver the snake around the board to collect points and reach the exit within the step limit while avoiding collisions and impassable cells.
