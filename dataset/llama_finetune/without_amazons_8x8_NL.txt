The game is played on an 8-by-8 grid with coordinates ranging from 1 to 8 along both axes, where positions are identified by their x and y indices. Two players participate, designated as white and black, taking turns in strict alternation with white moving first. At the start, each player has four pieces placed on specific cells: white occupies the cells at (1,3), (3,1), (6,1), and (8,3), while black occupies (1,6), (3,8), (6,8), and (8,6). The game proceeds in a cycle of two phases per player: a move phase followed by a fire phase. On a player's move turn, they may move one of their pieces along a straight path in any of the eight compass directions—north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, or northwest—provided that the path to the destination cell is unobstructed by any occupied cells. The destination cell must be empty, and the direction of movement must be consistent throughout the move. After moving a piece, the player enters the fire phase, during which they must fire an arrow from the newly moved piece's position in a straight, unobstructed line along any of the eight directions. The arrow lands in an empty cell reachable by a clear path from the just-moved piece, and this cell becomes occupied by an arrow marker, permanently blocking that position. Players may also choose to perform a no-operation (noop) action, but only when it is the opponent's turn to move or fire, effectively passing the turn without changing the state. Moves and fires must only be executed when it is the appropriate phase of the player's turn, and the legality of each action is determined by the occupancy and directional constraints. The state updates automatically after each action: moving a piece vacates its original cell and occupies the new cell, firing places an arrow on the targeted empty cell, and turn control switches accordingly, from move to fire for the same player, then from fire to move for the opposing player. The game enforces boundary constraints corresponding to the 8x8 board and prohibits movement or firing through or onto occupied cells. The game ends when the player whose turn it is to move has no legal moves available. Scoring is binary and zero-sum: the player who cannot move on their turn receives a score of zero, while the opponent is awarded a score of 100, thereby determining the winner. Overall, the game challenges players to maneuver their pieces strategically while blocking their opponent's movements by firing arrows that permanently occupy cells on the board.
