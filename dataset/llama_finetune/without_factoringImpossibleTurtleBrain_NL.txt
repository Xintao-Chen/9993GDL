The game is played on a two-dimensional grid defined by coordinates where the first coordinate ranges from 0 to 19 and the second coordinate ranges from 1 to 2, forming a board with 40 cells in total. Each cell is identified by three indices: the first index represents the series or group number (from 0 to 19), and the second and third indices specify the position within that series, either 1 or 2. The only player role in this game is the "robot," who takes turns performing actions. The game begins with all cells initialized to a state value of 0 and a step counter set to 0; the current series game is also initialized to 0. Turn control is managed by the robot acting alone, and at each turn, the robot may perform a single legal action or a no-operation; legal actions are of the form "press z x y," where z is the series index, and x and y are positional indices within that series. An action is legal only if the series z matches the current seriesGame value and x and y are valid indices (either 1 or 2). When the robot presses a cell, that cell's state is immediately set to 4; in subsequent turns, any cell in state 4 automatically degrades by one level each step, moving to states 3, then 2, then 1, and finally 0, unless it is pressed again. Cells not pressed remain in their current state unless they are already at 0, which is the lowest state. The "step" counter increments by one with each turn, and at specific steps—namely 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, and 80—the current seriesGame value advances to the next integer, thereby changing the series of cells that the robot is allowed to press. This progression controls which series the robot can act upon at any given time. The game imposes implicit constraints that actions must be within the board boundaries, and only cells in the current series can be pressed. The termination condition is met when the step counter reaches 84, at which point the game ends. Victory is determined by whether any series from 10 through 19 has all four cells in that series lit—that is, in a nonzero state (1, 2, 3, or 4)—simultaneously. If such a series is lit, the robot achieves a goal score of 100, indicating a win; otherwise, the score is 0. Thus, the robot’s objective is to press cells within the allowed series before the step count reaches 84 and to maintain at least one of the higher-numbered series fully lit to secure a win.
