This game is played on an 11 by 11 grid with coordinates labeled from 1 through 11 along both the X and Y axes, defining the board's environment and coordinate system. There are two players, player1 and player2, who alternate turns throughout the game. The game begins in an initial setup phase consisting of six sequential setup steps, during which players place pieces on the board in a predetermined order: player1 places black pieces in steps 1 and 3, player1 places white pieces in step 2, player2 places white pieces in step 4, and player2 places black pieces in step 5. After the setup completes at step 6, players pick their color—either black or white—with player2 picking first at setup step 4 and player1 picking at step 6; once a player picks a color, that color is associated with them for the remainder of the game. Turn control alternates between players, starting with player1 after setup, with the control passing to the opponent each turn. On a player's turn, if they have control, they may legally place a piece of their assigned color on any empty cell of the board; placement actions must specify the coordinates of the cell to occupy, and the target cell must be unoccupied within the board boundaries defined by the indices from 1 to 11. Players may also issue a noop action, which is only legal when the player does not have control or during certain setup steps, effectively passing their turn without action. The state updates after each turn to include newly placed pieces and switch control to the other player. The game enforces implicit constraints such as forbidding placement on occupied cells and restricting moves to within the board coordinates. The game terminates either when no empty cells remain or when a player achieves a line of six consecutive pieces of their color in any horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction; these lines must be exactly six in length, bounded on both ends by either empty space or opponent's pieces to qualify. The scoring system awards 100 points to the player who forms such a line, zero points to the opponent in that case, and if neither player has formed a line and the board is full, both players receive a score of 50. Thus, victory is achieved by being the first to form an unbroken line of six pieces of one's color, or by ending with the highest score if the board fills without such a line.
