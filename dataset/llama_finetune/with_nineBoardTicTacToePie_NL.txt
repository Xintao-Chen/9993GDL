This game is played on a four-dimensional grid with coordinates labeled i, j, k, and l, each ranging from 1 to 3, forming a 3x3x3x3 board. There are two players, named red and blue, who alternate turns with red moving first. The red player uses the marker "x" and the blue player uses the marker "o", although these assignments can be swapped by the blue player once per game through a special "swap" action. The initial state sets red as the player in control and assigns the markers accordingly, with the swap option available. On a player's turn, if they do not have control, their only legal move is to pass by performing a "noop" action. When a player has control, they can choose to place their marker on an empty cell specified by its four coordinates, provided the cell is unoccupied. During the very first move, the current board is considered empty and the player must place their marker on any empty cell. Otherwise, moves must be made on the current active board, identified by coordinates k and l, which is a 3x3 sub-board within the larger 4D grid; this current board can change as players place markers in different sub-boards. The blue player may also execute a "swap" action instead of placing a marker, but only if the swap option is still available, which then exchanges the markers used by red and blue for the rest of the game and disables future swaps. After each play action, the chosen cell is marked with the player's current marker and control passes to the opposing player. If blue performs a swap, the markers for red and blue switch accordingly but the control remains with blue until their next action. The game enforces implicit constraints including the board boundaries defined by the indices 1 to 3 in each dimension, that a cell must be empty to be marked, and that the current board must be either the first move or a previously defined sub-board that is completely filled before moving on. The game concludes when a line of three identical markers is formed in any of the dimensions or diagonals within any 3x3 sub-board, or when there are no empty cells left on the current board, indicating a closed board state. Lines can be horizontal rows, vertical columns, or either of the two main diagonals within a 3x3 board at fixed coordinates. Victory is determined by awarding 100 points to a player who completes such a line with their marker. If the board is full without any completed lines, the players receive 50 points each, signifying a draw. Any other state at termination results in zero points. The game thus requires strategic placement of markers within the multidimensional board, using turns alternately, with an optional swap by blue to gain a tactical advantage, and concludes when a player successfully forms a line or the board is filled, with points assigned accordingly.
