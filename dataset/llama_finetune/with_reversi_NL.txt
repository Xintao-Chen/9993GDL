The game is played on an 8x8 grid, with coordinates indexed from 1 to 8 along both the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) axes, forming a standard two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system where each cell is identified by its x and y coordinates. There are two player roles, black and red, which alternate turns throughout the game; black moves first as indicated by the initial control state. The game begins with four pieces placed near the center of the board: black pieces occupy cells (4,4) and (5,5), while red pieces occupy cells (4,5) and (5,4). The player who has control at any point is the one who makes the current move, and control switches to the opposing player after each turn. If a player has no legal moves available, they may pass their turn by performing a no-operation (noop) action. 

On their turn, a player may either choose to place a piece on an empty cell or pass if no moves are possible. A legal move involves placing a piece on an empty cell that is adjacent in any direction—north, south, east, west, or any of the four diagonals—to at least one opponent’s piece, and such that in that direction there exists a continuous line of one or more opponent pieces ending with a piece of the current player’s color, effectively "sandwiching" the opponent’s pieces. The directions are defined relative to the grid with increments or decrements of one in x and/or y coordinates accordingly, allowing identification of neighboring cells. Occupied cells cannot be chosen for moves, and all moves must remain within the boundaries of the 8x8 board. 

When a piece is placed, it captures all opponent pieces that lie in straight lines in any of the eight directions between the newly placed piece and other pieces of the current player’s color; these captured pieces are flipped to the current player’s color. This flipping is processed automatically following the move, and the board state updates accordingly. The game ends when neither player can make a legal move, signaling the terminal condition. At this point, the scores are calculated by counting the total number of pieces each player owns on the board. The player with the greater number of pieces is declared the winner and receives a score of 100, while the loser receives 0. In the event of a tie with no clear winner, both players receive a neutral score of 50. This scoring system incentivizes controlling the majority of the board at the end of play. Overall, the game combines strategic placement and area control within a bounded grid, alternating turns with enforced move legality and automatic piece flipping to determine the final outcome.
