The game is played on a standard 8-by-8 board with files labeled from a to h and ranks numbered from 1 to 8, forming a coordinate system where each cell is identified by a file and a rank. The entire board initially consists of empty cells, each marked as blank. There is a single player role named white who takes turns sequentially, and on each turn, the white player may perform exactly one action or choose to do nothing; however, the provided rules only specify actions for the white player. The initial state places all cells as blank and sets the points score to zero, with a special initial marker indicating the start of the game. On each turn, the white player may place a knight piece on any blank cell by specifying its coordinates; this action is legal only if the targeted cell is currently blank. When a knight is placed on a cell, that cell's state changes from blank to occupied by a white knight, while all other cells retain their previous state unless directly affected by this placement. The game maintains a points counter that increments by one after each placement action, starting from zero at the initial state. The game enforces implicit board boundaries by restricting placements strictly within the defined coordinates from a to h and 1 to 8, and no cell can be occupied by more than one piece at any time; thus, the placement action must target an unoccupied cell. A key automatic event is the detection of whether any two knights on the board can attack each other following the movement pattern of a knight in chess: moving two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular to that, defined by adjacency relations between files and ranks. The terminal condition occurs when there exists at least one pair of knights on the board such that one can move to the other's position using a valid knight move, meaning the knights threaten each other. The scoring or victory condition corresponds to the current points value, which reflects the number of knights successfully placed without conflict; the goal for the white player is to maximize this count. Throughout, the game enforces that knight moves and placements respect the adjacency and distance relationships inherent to knight movement, as well as ensuring no overlap of pieces, preserving the integrity of the board state and the progression of play until the terminal condition is met.
