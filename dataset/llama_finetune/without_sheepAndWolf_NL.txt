The game takes place on an 8x8 grid with coordinates labeled from c1 to c8 along both axes, establishing a square board environment. There are two player roles: the wolf and the sheep, who alternate turns with the wolf moving first followed by the sheep. The initial state positions a wolf on cell c4 c8 and multiple sheep on cells c1 c1, c3 c1, c5 c1, and c7 c1, with all remaining cells initially empty (denoted as b). Turns are controlled strictly in alternating fashion, and a player not having a legal move may perform a noop (no operation) action; notably, the wolf may noop only when it is the sheep's turn, and the sheep may noop only when it is the wolf's turn, ensuring proper turn flow. Each action consists of a move command specifying a piece's current coordinates and its target adjacent coordinates; moves are legal only if the piece belongs to the player whose turn it is, the piece is located at the starting cell, the target cell is empty, and the target cell is adjacent based on role-specific adjacency rules. The wolf’s adjacency includes all eight surrounding cells diagonally, horizontally, and vertically, whereas the sheep’s adjacency is limited to the four diagonal neighboring cells. Moves result in updating the board state by relocating the piece to the target cell and marking its previous cell empty, while all other cells retain their states unless occupied by the moved piece. Control alternates after each move. Implicit constraints include the board boundaries defined by c1 through c8 on both axes, preventing moves off the board, and occupancy conflicts prohibiting moving onto occupied cells. The game terminates when one of three conditions is met: the wolf is positioned behind the sheep in terms of the y-coordinate (i.e., the wolf's y-coordinate is numerically greater than any sheep's y-coordinate), or either the wolf or the sheep have no legal moves available. Victory is determined by scoring 100 points for the wolf if it remains moveable at termination, or 0 otherwise; conversely, the sheep score 100 points if the wolf is immobile at termination, or 0 if the wolf can still move. Thus, the game revolves around the wolf attempting to maneuver behind the sheep while the sheep try to block or immobilize the wolf, with movement restricted by adjacency and board boundaries, and the turn structure ensuring orderly play and the possibility of noop actions when a player cannot move.
