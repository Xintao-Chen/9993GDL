The game is played on an 8 by 8 grid with coordinates ranging from 1 to 8 for both the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) axes. There are two players, designated as white and black, who take turns alternately starting with white. Initially, white occupies all cells in the first two rows (y=1 and y=2) across all columns (x=1 to 8), while black occupies all cells in the last two rows (y=7 and y=8) across all columns. On a player’s turn, they may either move one of their pieces or perform a noop if it is not their turn. A move consists of shifting a piece from its current cell to a legally adjacent cell under specific conditions. For white, legal moves involve moving a piece forward one cell vertically (from y to y+1) either straight ahead or diagonally by one column to the left or right, provided the destination cell is empty or not occupied by another white piece; similarly, black moves forward one cell vertically downward (from y to y−1) with the same lateral options, ensuring the destination is not occupied by black. Moves cannot wrap around the board edges, and pieces cannot move onto cells occupied by their own color. Noops are only legal when it is the opponent’s turn to move. After a move, the piece relocates to the new cell, the origin cell becomes empty, and control passes to the other player. The game ends when a white piece reaches the top row (y=8), or black reaches the bottom row (y=1), or when one player no longer has any pieces on the board. Upon termination, the player who achieved these conditions wins and receives a score of 100, while the opponent gets 0. The game enforces constraints such as the board boundaries, distinctness of source and destination cells in moves, and ensures that a cell is either empty or occupied by only one piece at a time, effectively preventing overlap. Thus, the objective is to strategically advance pieces forward toward the opponent’s baseline or eliminate all opposing pieces to secure victory.
