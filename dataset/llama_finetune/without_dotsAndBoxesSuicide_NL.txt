This game is played on a grid defined by coordinates indexed from 1 through 6 along both the horizontal and vertical axes, forming a 6-by-6 lattice of points. Two players, named xplayer and oplayer, alternate turns in a fixed sequence where the player controlling the current turn attempts to draw a line segment between two adjacent points on the grid. The turn order cycles through these players, with xplayer moving first and then oplayer, and so on. Initially, no lines have been drawn, no boxes are claimed, and xplayer has control to make the first move. On a player's turn, they must either draw a single line segment between two undrawn adjacent points—either vertically or horizontally adjacent indices that do not yet have a connecting line—or, if it is not their turn, they must perform a no-operation action, which is legal only when they do not have control. Actions are specified by the player indicating a draw command with the coordinates of the two points to be connected; this action is only legal if the line between those points is currently undrawn and the player has control. When a player draws a line, the game state updates to include that line permanently. The drawing of a line may result in the formation of one or more boxes—defined as unit squares bounded by four lines—if that new line completes the fourth side of such a box. A box is considered formed if the four edges surrounding a square between consecutive coordinate indices are all drawn. If one box is formed by a player's action, their box count increases by one; if two boxes are formed simultaneously, their box count increases by two accordingly. Importantly, if any box is formed during a player's turn, they retain control and get another move; control only passes to the other player if no box is completed during the turn. The game imposes implicit constraints that lines must connect adjacent points within the grid boundaries, no line may be drawn twice, and boxes may only be claimed when fully enclosed. The game ends when there are no remaining undrawn lines on the grid, i.e., when all possible edges between points have been drawn. The victory condition is determined by comparing the number of boxes claimed by each player: the player with the higher count of boxes wins, while a tie results in a win for oplayer as per the definition. Scoring assigns 100 points to the winning player and 0 points to the loser, with the tie condition awarding victory—and thus 100 points—to oplayer. Thus, the game encapsulates a classic dots-and-boxes style competition on a 6-by-6 grid, emphasizing strategic line drawing to claim boxes and control turn order until all edges are drawn and a winner is declared by the number of boxes claimed.
