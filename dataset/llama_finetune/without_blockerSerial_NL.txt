The game is played on two separate 4-by-4 grids, each defined by coordinates where the first number represents the column from 1 to 4 and the second number the row from 1 to 4, with cells identified accordingly. There are two player roles: the crosser and the blocker, who alternate turns throughout the game. Initially, all cells on both boards are marked as blank. The game proceeds in two phases, controlled by a condition called game1Over; before this condition is met, players place marks on the first board, and afterward, they place marks on the second board. On each turn, a player must mark exactly one blank cell on the current board with their respective symbol—"crosser" or "blocker"—and the chosen cell must not already be occupied. The blocker’s moves mark cells as blocked, while the crosser’s moves mark cells as crossed, and both players’ moves occur simultaneously in the state update, with the constraint that they cannot mark the same cell in the same turn. Cells retain their markings indefinitely once placed unless the game state changes boards after the first phase ends. The first phase terminates when either the crosser forms a continuous sequence of four crosser-marked cells in the first column through contiguous rows on the first board, or when there are no blank cells left on that board, locking the game state and triggering the second phase on the second board. The second phase ends under similar conditions on the second board. Continuity between cells is defined by a "cont" relationship linking adjacent cells along rows or columns. The blocker wins points by preventing the crosser from creating such a continuous bridge of crossed cells on either board and by filling cells to block potential crossings; the crosser wins points by successfully creating these continuous bridges on both boards. Specifically, if the crosser achieves a bridge on a board, they score maximum points for that board while the blocker scores zero, and vice versa if no bridge is formed and the board is fully blocked. The overall game ends when the second phase’s terminal condition is met, and the final scores reflect the combined results from both boards, determining the winner. Players have no option to pass or perform no-operation moves; they must mark a valid blank cell on their turn according to the current phase, maintaining the turn order and legality constraints throughout.
