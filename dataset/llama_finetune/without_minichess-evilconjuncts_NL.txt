The game is played on a 4-by-4 grid with coordinates labeled from 'a' to 'd' horizontally and from 1 to 4 vertically, where the columns proceed in order a, b, c, d and rows proceed numerically from 1 to 4. Two players, White and Black, alternate turns, with White moving first, controlling the white pieces initially. The initial board setup places the white king at c1, the white rook at d1, the black king at a4, and all other cells are empty. The game proceeds in steps, starting at step 1 and incrementing by one each turn, with the game terminating either when 10 steps have been completed or when a player is stuck and unable to move. On White's turn, the player may move either the white king or the white rook to an unoccupied cell that is not restricted, following the movement rules for kings (one square adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) and rooks (any number of squares along a clear row or column without jumping over obstructing pieces). White can only move pieces from cells they occupy to empty cells that are not marked as restricted. On Black's turn, the black king may move one square similarly but only to empty cells that are neither attacked nor guarded; "attacked" cells are those threatened by the white rook along clear rows or columns, and "guarded" cells are those adjacent to the white king. Black may only move the black king to safe squares that are neither attacked nor guarded. If it is not a player's turn, they may pass by performing a noop action, which is legal only when it is the opponent's turn. Moves are specified by indicating the piece moved, its current coordinates, and the destination coordinates. After a move, the piece's position updates accordingly, the previously occupied cell becomes empty, and all other cells remain unchanged unless directly affected by the move. Control alternates between White and Black each turn, and the step counter increases by one. The game enforces implicit constraints such as staying within board boundaries, ensuring that no two pieces occupy the same cell, and respecting the adjacency and linear movement relations described. The black king is considered in check if it occupies a cell attacked by the white rook or adjacent to the white king's control, and the game ends with a checkmate condition if the black king is in check and has no legal moves, or if the black king is stuck with no legal moves. White wins by delivering checkmate, scoring 100 points, while Black wins by avoiding checkmate, scoring 100 points if checkmate does not occur. The game terminates either at checkmate, if the black king is stuck with no moves, or after 10 steps have elapsed.
