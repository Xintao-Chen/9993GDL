The game is played on a 10-by-10 grid where each cell is identified by coordinates ranging from 1 to 10 along both the x and y axes. There are two players, designated as white and black, who alternate taking turns. The initial setup places a white piece at cell (1,1) and a black piece at cell (10,10), with white having the first move control. Each turn consists of two phases: a move phase controlled by the player whose turn it is, followed by an attack phase controlled by the same player. During the move phase, the active player must move their piece according to a knight's move pattern—an L-shaped move similar to that in chess—such that the target cell is unoccupied by the opponent's piece. The move action is specified by the starting and ending cell coordinates of the piece being moved and is legal only if the moving player controls the piece at the starting cell and the target cell is not occupied by the opponent. After the move, control switches to the attack phase for the same player, during which the player may choose to perform an orthogonal or diagonal attack, or opt to do nothing (noop). An orthogonal attack targets an adjacent cell either horizontally or vertically, while a diagonal attack targets one adjacent cell diagonally. These attacks convert an opponent's piece in the targeted cell into an "arrow," effectively neutralizing that piece. The attack actions are legal only if it is the attack phase for the acting player, and no conflict exists with the opponent's control. If the opponent controls either the move or attack phase, the player may also choose a noop action, effectively passing without making a move or attack. After the attack phase, control returns to the opponent's move phase, continuing the turn cycle. The board boundaries are strictly enforced; all moves and attacks must occur within cells numbered 1 through 10 in both dimensions. Pieces cannot move into or attack cells occupied by arrows, and no two pieces can occupy the same cell. The game ends when one player manages to have at least one cell occupied by an arrow while simultaneously still occupying a cell that the opponent also occupies with an arrow; more specifically, when there is a cell with an arrow and a cell occupied by the opponent's piece, the other player is declared the winner. Victory is awarded 100 points to the winning player and 0 to the loser. This means that a player's goal is to strategically maneuver their piece using knight moves and then attack orthogonally or diagonally to convert opposing pieces into arrows, thereby constraining the opponent's movement and achieving the terminal winning condition. The gameplay thus revolves around alternating between moving pieces in knight-like patterns and attacking adjacent cells, with the ability to pass turns during the opponent's control phases, all while respecting the 10x10 board limits and avoiding illegal moves onto occupied or out-of-bound cells.
