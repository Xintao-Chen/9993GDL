The game takes place on a grid defined by coordinates where the x and y indices range over the values 1 and 2, forming a 2x2 board for each series indexed by z, which can be 0, 1, or 2. The environment tracks the state of each cell on this board, with cell states represented by integers from 0 to 4, where 0 signifies no light and 4 signifies a freshly pressed light. There is a single player role named "robot," who takes turns performing actions. The game begins with all cells in all series initialized to state 0, and the step counter set to 0. Each turn, the robot may choose to perform a press action targeting a specific series and cell coordinate, specified as (press z x y) where z is the series, and x and y are the cell coordinates, both of which must be valid indices (1 or 2) and the targeted series must match the current game series state. This press action is the only legal move for the player, effectively serving as the primary means to interact with the game; there is no explicit noop action, so the player must always choose a press within the legal constraints. When a cell is pressed, its state immediately becomes 4 on the next state update, indicating it has been activated. In subsequent steps, the cell's state automatically decreases by one each turn, cycling from 4 down to 3, then 2, then 1, and finally back to 0, representing a fading light effect. Cells that are at state 0 remain at 0 unless pressed again. The game advances the global step counter by one each turn, and the seriesGame variable progresses from 0 to 1 at step 20, and from 1 to 2 at step 40, indicating a change in the active series at these milestones. The game terminates automatically after 60 steps have been completed. A key implicit constraint is the fixed 2x2 board size for each series, with no possibility to press outside these coordinates. The game tracks whether a series has been "won," which occurs when all four cells in that series are lit, meaning their states are at least 1 (on). Specifically, the condition for a series to be considered won is that all four cells at coordinates (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2) within that series have a cell state greater than 0. Victory is achieved if any of the series 0, 1, or 2 is won by the time the game ends, granting the robot a goal score of 100; otherwise, the goal score is 0. Thus, the player's objective is to press cells in such a way as to keep all four cells in at least one series lit simultaneously before the terminal step 60 is reached. The progression of lights fading over time requires the player to judiciously time presses to maintain lights on all four cells in a series long enough to claim victory.
