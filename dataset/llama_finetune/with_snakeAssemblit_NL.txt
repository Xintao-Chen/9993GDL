The game is played on a 6-by-6 board with rows and columns numbered from 1 to 6, arranged in a cyclic order where each number succeeds another in a circular fashion (e.g., 1 succeeds 6 and 2 succeeds 1). There are two players, designated as red and blue, each controlling different roles: red controls a "snake" and blue controls an "assembler." The initial state places the blue player at coordinates (3,4) and the red player at (4,3), with both these positions initially marked. Each player starts with a score of zero and seven available marks to place. The game proceeds in turns alternating control between the snake and assembler roles, with the snake and assembler roles themselves alternating control between the red and blue players. The control alternates so that first the red player controls the snake, then the blue player controls the assembler, then control switches, continuing in this fashion. A "step" counter increments each turn, starting at zero, and the game ends automatically if this step count reaches 40.

On a player's turn, they must perform an action legal for their current role and control. The assembler player can move up, down, left, or right by one row or column, provided the move keeps them within the board boundaries as defined by the cyclic successor relations among rows and columns. Additionally, the assembler can perform a "shift" action in any direction (up, down, left, or right) on the board's rows or columns, which cyclically shifts the marked positions accordingly. The assembler may also place a "mark" at their current position on the board if they have remaining marks to place (greater than zero). The snake player can move one cell up, down, left, or right only if the destination cell is unoccupied by any player or obstacle, remains on the board, and does not cause a collision with the other player's occupied cells. The snake's position is represented by "cells," and moves are allowed only into empty cells adjacent in one of the four cardinal directions. If the snake attempts an illegal move such as moving off-board, into an occupied cell, or causing a collision, it results in an error state for that player.

Each action updates the game state accordingly: the assembler's movement updates their position on the board; shifts cyclically move marked cells in the chosen row or column, and any marks influenced by these shifts are updated to new positions. Placing a mark adds a marked cell at the assembler's current location and decreases their remaining marks count by one. The snake's moves update the cells it occupies on the board, moving to the adjacent open cell in the chosen direction. The game enforces occupancy constraints: no two players can occupy the same cell, and the snake cannot move into a cell marked as empty or off the board.

Scores are updated each turn based on the player's position relative to marked cells. Specifically, if a player occupies a row or column that contains marked cells, their score increases by one for each such alignment, with a double increment if both row and column conditions are met and the player is not currently on a marked cell. The maximum score caps at 50 points.

The game terminates either when the step limit of 40 is reached or if an error occurs for either player, such as the snake crashing into itself or the other player, moving off the board, or making an illegal move. Upon termination due to an error, the player who erred receives a lower score, and the other player is awarded higher points accordingly. If the game ends due to reaching the step limit, the final scores reflect the accumulated points from marks and positions on the board.

Thus, the game is a turn-based contest on a cyclic 6-by-6 board, where two players alternate controlling a snake and an assembler, making moves constrained by adjacency, occupancy, and board boundaries. Players place marks and shift rows or columns to influence scoring, while the snake maneuvers carefully to avoid illegal moves or collisions. The objective is to maximize one's score by strategic movement and marking before the game ends either by step limit or error, with victory determined by the final scores assigned under these conditions.
