The game is played on a linear environment consisting of twelve distinct positions arranged sequentially and numbered from one to twelve. The coordinate system is a simple one-dimensional sequence with each position capable of being empty or occupied by a stone. There are two players, designated as black and red, who alternate turns beginning with the black player. Initially, all twelve positions are empty, no stones are placed, and the control is assigned to the black player; the game step counter starts at one. On each turn, the player in control may perform one of the legal actions: adding a stone of their color to an empty position that is allowed for play, removing one of their own stones from such a position, or performing a no-operation (noop) move if it is not their turn to play. The noop action is only legal for the player who does not currently have control, effectively passing the turn to the opponent. To add a stone, the targeted position must be empty and considered a legal play location, the stone type must be valid, and the player must not have already placed two stones of that type; furthermore, the player cannot add a stone of the same type to the same position if they removed it in the previous turn. To remove a stone, the position must be currently occupied by a stone owned by the player and also be a legal play location. After a player's action, control switches to the other player, and the step counter increments by one. The state updates automatically depending on the actions: if a stone is added to a position, that position becomes occupied by that stone; if a stone is removed, the position becomes empty. Positions not affected by the current action maintain their previous occupancy status, and ownership of stones remains consistent unless changed through removal or addition. Implicit constraints include the boundaries of the board (positions one through twelve), the requirement that stones can only be placed on empty and legal positions, and that no more than two stones of the same type may be present at once. The game ends when the predefined terminal conditions are met, which are not explicitly detailed here but typically involve no further legal moves or achieving a victory condition. Victory criteria are not explicitly stated in the provided description, implying the need for additional context or rules to determine scoring or winning. Overall, the game structure enforces alternating turns with careful management of stone placement and removal within a bounded linear board, ensuring orderly progression and state consistency through well-defined legal actions and state transitions.
