The game is played on an 8-by-8 grid with columns labeled from 'a' through 'h' and rows numbered 1 through 8, where coordinates combine a file (column) and a rank (row). Two players, white and black, take alternating turns beginning with white. The initial setup places white pawns on the second rank across files a to h, a white king at d1, black pawns on the seventh rank across files a to h, and a black king at d8; the game starts at step 1 with control assigned to white. On a player's turn, they may perform a move action or, if no legal moves are available or the player has no remaining pieces, they may choose a noop action. A move is specified by indicating the starting cell coordinates (file and rank) and the target cell coordinates (file and rank). Moves are legal if, for white pawns, they move one rank forward (from rank y to y+1) either straight forward into an unoccupied cell or diagonally one file adjacent when capturing, without moving onto a cell occupied by another white piece; black pawns move similarly but one rank backward (from rank y to y−1), with the same occupancy restrictions. The kings for both colors may move one cell in any direction except directly backward (white kings cannot move to the previous rank, black kings cannot move to the next rank), provided the target cell is not occupied by a friendly piece. The coordinates must remain within the board boundaries, and moves must respect adjacency rules for files and ranks. After a move, the piece vacates its original cell and occupies the new one; any opponent piece on the destination cell is captured and removed from play, including capturing the opponent’s king, which is tracked as a captured state. The step count increments by one each turn. The game terminates if either king is captured, if a king reaches the opponent’s back rank (white king on rank 8 or black king on rank 1) while the opposing king is still on the board, or when the step count reaches 61. Victory is assigned to white if the white king reaches rank 8 without being captured or if the black king is captured; black wins similarly if the black king reaches rank 1 or the white king is captured. If none of these conditions are met by the end of the game, both players receive a draw score. The scoring awards 100 points to the winner, 0 to the loser, and 50 points to each player in case of a draw. The game enforces that no moves can place a piece on a square occupied by a friendly piece, and no piece may move outside the board. Turn control alternates strictly between the two players, and the noop action serves as a pass only when no other legal moves exist or the player has no pieces left.
