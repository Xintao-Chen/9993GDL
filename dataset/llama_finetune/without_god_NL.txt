The game takes place on a 5-by-5 grid with coordinates from 1 to 5 for both rows and columns, where each cell can be either occupied by a living entity or be barren. The single player role, called "robot," acts in turns, and the game starts at step zero with an initial configuration of cells marked as either occupied or barren according to a predefined layout. On each turn, the robot may perform exactly one action: a kill action targeting a specific cell identified by its row and column coordinates. Such a kill action is legal only if the targeted cell is currently occupied by a living entity. If the robot does not perform any kill action, it effectively performs a no-operation for that turn, and the game state advances by one step regardless. After each action, the game state updates automatically according to specific rules that count the number of occupied neighboring cells for each cell—neighbors include all adjacent cells horizontally, vertically, and diagonally—and determine whether cells become occupied or barren in the next step based on these counts and whether a kill action was performed on them. Cells that were killed become barren in the next state, while others may survive or change status depending on their neighbors, following constraints that forbid cells from having exactly two, three, four, or five occupied neighbors to remain barren or occupied, accordingly. The board boundaries are implicitly enforced by the grid size; any neighbor counting respects these limits, and no cell can be outside the 1-to-5 range in either coordinate. Multiple occupancy is impossible, as each cell can hold only one state at a time. The game terminates either when the board becomes completely clear of occupied cells or when 30 steps have elapsed. The player's score depends on the number of occupied cells remaining at termination, with higher scores awarded for fewer occupied cells: a perfect score of 100 is given if no occupied cells remain, scaling down to zero as the count of living occupied cells increases beyond certain thresholds. The robot’s objective is thus to strategically choose kill actions each turn to reduce occupied cells effectively before the game ends automatically due to clearing or step limit.
