The game is played on a board defined by a coordinate system consisting of files labeled from 'a' to 'j' and ranks numbered from 1 to 10, establishing a grid of 10 columns and 10 rows. Each cell on this board can be occupied by either a white or black piece, with the initial placement determined by predefined sets of files and ranks assigned to each player; white pieces occupy cells in files a, c, e, g, and i combined with ranks 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, while black pieces occupy files b, d, f, h, and j with ranks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, resulting in an interlaced starting pattern. Two players, white and black, alternate turns with white moving first as the player in control at the start. On their turn, a player may perform a move action or, if it is not their turn, perform a no-operation (noop). Moves are specified by indicating the coordinates of the piece to be moved (source x1,y1) and the target cell (destination x2,y2). A move is legal if the player is in control and the move either captures an opponent's piece located along a valid diagonal path (one of four diagonal directions: northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest), or, if the moving piece currently does not threaten any opposing piece, it may move to an empty cell along such a diagonal line provided that the empty cell is itself threatened by an opponent's piece, ensuring a form of positional tension. The board enforces constraints such that moves must remain within the boundaries defined by the initial files and ranks, and movement is restricted to diagonally adjacent cells or extended diagonals through empty spaces, as determined by successive adjacent cells in valid diagonal directions. Occupancy conflicts are prevented by disallowing moves onto cells already occupied unless capturing an opponent's piece. After a move, the piece is relocated to the target cell, and the source cell is vacated; control switches to the opposing player automatically. The game terminates when a player has no pieces remaining on the board, which is detected by the absence of any cells occupied by that player's pieces. Victory is awarded to the player who still has pieces on the board, scoring 100 points, while the defeated player scores zero. This setup encourages strategic diagonal movement and capturing across a 10x10 board with alternating moves and careful positioning to threaten opponent pieces and control critical empty spaces.
