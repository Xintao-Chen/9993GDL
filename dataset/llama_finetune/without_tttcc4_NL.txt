The game is played on a 7-by-7 grid with coordinates ranging from 1 to 7 along both the x and y axes, but the outermost rows and columns (i.e., those with x or y equal to 1 or 7) are excluded from valid play positions, effectively creating a 5-by-5 playable area from coordinates 2 to 6. There are three players: red, yellow, and blue, who take turns in a fixed rotation order, starting with red, then yellow, then blue, and repeating cyclically. The initial setup places each player's pieces in the corners of the board within the playable area: red's pawn, checker, and knight occupy cells (1,5), (1,4), and (1,3) respectively; yellow's pieces occupy (3,1), (4,1), and (5,1); and blue's pieces occupy (7,3), (7,4), and (7,5). The game proceeds in discrete steps, starting at step 1, with each player controlling the game during their turn. On a turn, the current player may either perform a legal move or choose to do nothing (noop). The noop action is always legal for any player, allowing passing of the turn without changes. Legal actions include dropping a disc piece onto one of three designated columns (3, 4, or 5) at the lowest available empty cell in that column, moving a pawn orthogonally or diagonally to an empty cell or to capture an opponent's piece diagonally, moving a knight in an L-shaped pattern (similar to a chess knight) to an empty cell or to capture an opponent's piece, moving a checker diagonally to an empty cell, or performing a jump move with a checker to leap over an adjacent opponent's piece in any diagonal direction (upleft, upright, downleft, downright) onto an empty cell immediately beyond. Moves that capture opponent pieces are allowed only if the target cell contains an opponent's piece distinct from the current player. All moves must remain within the bounds of the playable area and cannot move onto occupied cells unless capturing. After a move, the game state updates accordingly: the moving piece relocates to the destination cell, the origin cell becomes empty, and any captured pieces are removed. If a player chooses to drop a disc, it occupies the lowest empty cell in the chosen chute column. The control then passes to the next player in the rotation sequence. The game terminates if any player forms a line of three of their pieces in a row, column, or diagonal within the central 3-by-3 area defined by cells (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5), or if the game reaches step 31 without any player achieving such a line. Victory is awarded to the player who first creates such a line, receiving a score of 100, while all other players score 0. If the game ends due to the step limit without any line formed, all players score 0. The game thus combines positional strategy with piece-specific movement rules, turn-based control, and a capture mechanic, all constrained by the board boundaries and occupancy rules, culminating in a race to form a three-in-a-row line in the central board area.
