The game is played by a single player role named "robot" in a discrete environment representing the configuration of a Rubik's Cube with pieces called "cubies" positioned and oriented in a three-dimensional spatial system implicitly defined by the cube's usual structure of corner and edge cubies. The initial state sets the cube pieces in specific positions and orientations, each cubie identified by color codes, and the step counter initialized to zero. The robot takes turns sequentially, with each turn allowing the player to either perform a turn action or do nothing via a noop action. The turn action consists of selecting one of six possible moves—up, down, left, right, front, or back—and a rotation angle of either 90, 180, or 270 degrees; these moves correspond to standard face rotations on the cube. A turn is legal if the robot chooses one of these moves with a valid angle or chooses noop; noop preserves the current state without changing positions or orientations. Executing a turn updates the position of each cubie according to the specified move and rotation angle, where the position transformation is defined by a sequence of "after" relations mapping the old position to a new one through intermediate states depending on the rotation angle. Similarly, cubie orientations are updated automatically for corner pieces by adding orientation increments affected by the move, repeated for multiple steps if the angle is greater than 90 degrees, while for edge pieces a flip operation toggles orientation states under certain moves, and orientations remain unchanged if the cubie is unaffected by the move or if the player does noop. The cube's state includes implicit constraints such as fixed boundaries corresponding to the cube's faces and the adjacency relationships between cubies that govern how positions transform under moves; cubies cannot occupy invalid positions outside the cube’s layout. The step counter increments by one after each action, tracking the progression of turns. The game terminates either when all cubies are correctly positioned and oriented—meaning each cubie matches its solved position with zero orientation offset—or when the step count reaches 50 turns, whichever comes first. The victory scoring criterion is the number of cubies correctly solved at the end of the game, with the maximum score being 100 if all cubies are correctly aligned. Throughout the game, the robot aims to perform sequences of legal turns to manipulate the cube towards the solved state, balancing efficient moves within the 50-turn limit to maximize the correctness of cubies at termination.
