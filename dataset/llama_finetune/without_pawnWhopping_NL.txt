This game is played on a two-dimensional grid with coordinates ranging from 1 to 8 along the horizontal axis (x-coordinate) and from 1 to 8 along the vertical axis (y-coordinate). There are two players, designated as "x" and "o," who alternate turns beginning with player x having the initial control. The initial setup places all of player o’s pieces on the entire seventh row and all of player x’s pieces on the entire second row, with no other pieces on the board. On a player's turn, they may either perform a move or capture action if legal moves are available; otherwise, they must execute a noop action, which is allowed only if the player is not currently in control or if they have no legal moves. The move actions for player x consist of moving a piece forward vertically one space from y to y+1, provided the target cell is unoccupied; additionally, player x can perform a special two-step forward move from row 2 to row 4 if both intermediate cells are unoccupied. Player o moves similarly but in the opposite vertical direction, moving pieces from y to y-1, with a special two-step move from row 7 to row 5 when the intermediate cells are free. Capture actions involve moving a piece diagonally forward by one cell, within one column to the left or right and one row forward (up for player x, down for player o), capturing an opponent’s piece occupying that cell. Moves and captures are only legal if the destination cells are within the board boundaries, unoccupied (for moves), or occupied by an opponent’s piece (for captures). After a move or capture, the piece’s position updates, and the player who moved relinquishes control to the opponent. The game prevents overlapping pieces by enforcing that no two pieces can occupy the same cell simultaneously. The game ends under two conditions: if either player has a piece reach the opponent’s baseline row (row 8 for x, row 1 for o), or if one player loses all their pieces. Additionally, the game terminates if neither player can make any legal moves. Victory is awarded to player x if they either have a piece on row 8 or player o has no remaining pieces, and to player o if they have a piece on row 1 or player x has no remaining pieces. In these cases, the victorious player receives a score of 100 points, and the defeated player receives zero points. If the game ends due to no legal moves for either player without a winner, both players receive a score of 50 points. This structure ensures a straightforward advancement and capture mechanism on an 8x8 board, with victory achieved by advancing pieces to the opponent’s baseline, eliminating all opponent pieces, or when neither player can continue moving.
