The game is played on a 3-by-3 grid defined by coordinates where the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) axes both range from 1 to 3, creating nine distinct cells initially all empty. There are two players, designated as "x" and "o," who alternate turns. The game begins in a "bidding" stage where each player starts with 10 coins. During this stage, players take turns placing bids, which are integer amounts no greater than the number of coins they currently possess, and each bid may optionally include a tiebreaker flag; the player who holds the current tiebreaker may bid with it, whereas the other player may bid without it. Legal bids must respect these constraints, and the bidding stage continues until a winner is determined by comparing bids: the player with the higher bid wins, or if bids tie, the one using the tiebreaker prevails; if both bids tie and neither uses the tiebreaker, then the player without the tiebreaker wins. After the bidding concludes, control passes to the winning player who then plays the marking stage. In this stage, the controlling player may place their mark (either "x" or "o") on any empty cell, with the legal action requiring that the chosen cell is currently blank. The other player may choose to perform a no-operation action (noop) only when it is not their turn to move. The game's state updates reflect coins being adjusted by adding the bid amounts to the players' coin counts after bidding, the tiebreaker status potentially transferring depending on the bid details, and cells being marked as players place their marks. The board constraints ensure marks can only be placed within the 3-by-3 grid and cannot overwrite occupied cells. The game ends when either a player forms a complete line of three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when no empty cells remain, indicating a draw. Victory is awarded 100 points to a player who completes such a line, zero points to the opponent if the opposing player wins, and in the absence of a winning line for either player, both receive 50 points. Turn control cycles between bidding and marking stages appropriately, and the noop action serves as a legal pass for the non-controlling player to maintain turn order without disrupting the game flow.
