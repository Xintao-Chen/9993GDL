This game takes place on an 8-by-8 grid with coordinates labeled from 1 to 8 along both the x and y axes. Four players participate, each assigned a unique role identified by a color: blue, red, green, and yellow. The order of play follows these roles, presumably in the sequence blue, red, green, then yellow, cycling continuously through the turns. At the start, each player’s brush piece is located on a specific starting cell: blue’s brush at (2,2), red’s at (2,7), green’s at (7,2), and yellow’s at (7,7). Correspondingly, these starting cells are initially colored to match the respective player's color, while the rest of the board begins uncolored. During each turn, a player may choose to move their brush to an adjacent cell—adjacency being defined as horizontally or vertically neighboring cells within the board boundaries—and by doing so, the player colors that cell with their own color. A player’s move is legal only if the cell they wish to move to is adjacent to their brush’s current location and is not already occupied by any brush. A player who is in a "dizzy" state, indicated by a status flag that lasts for two full turns after an interaction, cannot move their brush. The dizzy state is triggered if a player attempts to move their brush onto a cell targeted simultaneously by at least one other player; in this case, none of the competing moves color the cell, but the involved players become dizzy starting the next turn. If a player is dizzy or if their brush is completely surrounded by occupied cells with no empty adjacent cells, their only legal action is to "feeldizzy," effectively a no-operation that allows the dizzy status to wear off. The brush positions update automatically based on each player's move, or remain unchanged if the player is dizzy or chooses to feeldizzy. The coloring of cells also updates accordingly: if a player successfully moves their brush to a cell without conflict, that cell’s color changes to that player’s color; if multiple players attempt to move to the same cell, that cell’s color remains as it was, and the involved players become dizzy. The game proceeds turn by turn with a step counter incrementing each turn until it reaches 20, at which point the game ends. Throughout the game, players accumulate points by counting the number of cells on the board that match their respective color. Victory is determined at the end after 20 steps by comparing the players’ scores: the player with the highest score receives the highest reward, while ties and placements are resolved with a tiered scoring system that assigns fractional or zero points based on relative standings and equalities among the four players. Players cannot move their brushes outside the 8x8 grid, and brush pieces cannot occupy the same cell simultaneously. The game’s goal is to maximize the number of cells painted with a player’s own color by strategically moving brushes, managing dizzy states, and competing for control over cells on the board before the 20th turn concludes the play.
