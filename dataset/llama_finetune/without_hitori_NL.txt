The game takes place on a 5-by-5 grid defined by coordinates ranging from 1 to 5 in both the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) directions, with each cell initially assigned a numeric value between 1 and 5 and a color, either 'e' (empty) or 'b' (blocked). There is a single player role who takes turns performing actions sequentially, with the game starting at step zero. On each turn, the player must choose an action of the form "write x y value color," where x and y specify the coordinates of the cell to modify, value is a numeric value between 1 and 5, and color is either 'e' or 'b'. An action is legal if it writes the 'b' color into a cell currently marked as 'e' and that cell is adjacent to other 'e'-colored cells horizontally or vertically with certain counting conditions related to consecutive values; alternatively, writing 'e' into a cell currently marked 'b' is allowed. The player can also effectively pass by choosing an action that does not change any cell state (a noop). After each action, the state updates so that the targeted cell reflects the newly written value and color while all other cells retain their previous states. The game automatically increments the step counter after each move. The board imposes constraints such as adjacency requirements for color changes and the preservation of cell occupancy rules, ensuring no conflicting color assignments occur and that numeric values maintain certain count relationships along rows and columns. The game terminates either after 100 steps have been taken or when all cells from (1,1) to (4,5) and from (1,1) to (5,4) satisfy a condition involving differences in cell values and colors according to specified recursive rules. The player's goal is to avoid reaching step 100, where a terminal state yields a minimal score of 1; otherwise, if the game ends before step 100, the player achieves a maximum score of 100, reflecting successful management of the boardâ€™s constraints and progression.
