The game is played on a board divided into four quadrants, each with a 3x3 grid of cells arranged in a coordinate system where both x and y indices range from 1 to 3 within each quadrant. These quadrants are positioned so that their local coordinates map onto a global 5x5 grid by offsetting the local coordinates with values of 0 or 3 for x and y, effectively positioning the quadrants to form the larger board. There are two players, designated as red and black, who alternate turns in a fixed sequence starting with red. The initial state grants the red player the right to place a piece first. On each player's turn, they may perform either a placement or a rotation action when it is their control phase, or they must perform a noop action if they do not have placement or rotation control. The control alternates between placing and rotating for each player in the order: red places, red rotates, black places, black rotates, then back to red placing, and so forth. Placement actions involve placing a piece of the player's color onto an empty cell within any quadrant, with the legality requiring that the cell is unoccupied. Rotation actions require the player to select one of the four quadrants and rotate it either clockwise or counterclockwise, with the rotation remapping pieces within the quadrant according to specific coordinate transformations defined by vertical or horizontal flips. A noop action is only legal when the player does not currently have placement or rotation control, effectively passing their turn. After any placement action, the state updates to hold the player's piece at that cell, while all other cells retain their previous state. After a rotation action, the pieces within the rotated quadrant are repositioned according to the rotation direction, while pieces in other quadrants remain unchanged. The board's boundaries and occupancy constraints are enforced implicitly by requiring placements only on empty cells within defined quadrants and indices, and rotations only on valid quadrants and directions. The game terminates when either player forms a line of five consecutive pieces in a row, column, or diagonal on the global 5x5 board, or when no empty cells remain on the board. The detection of a line involves verifying that five contiguous cells along a row, column, or diagonal are all held by the same player, considering the global indexing that maps quadrant-local coordinates to the full board. Scoring is assigned based on the terminal condition: a player who forms such a line while the opponent does not receives 100 points, if neither player has formed a line but the board is full, both players score 50 points, and if both players simultaneously have lines, both receive 50 points. Conversely, a player who loses by the opponent forming a line alone or when the board is still open without any line scores 0 points. This structure ensures a strategic interplay of placing pieces and rotating quadrants to create or block five-in-a-row lines, with the game's state evolving through player actions and automatic updates in piece positions and control phases.
