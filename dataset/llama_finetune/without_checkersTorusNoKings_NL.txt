The game takes place on an 8-by-8 grid where each cell is identified by coordinates ranging from 1 to 8 for both x (columns) and y (rows). The board cells are distinguished by "even squares," defined as those whose x and y coordinates are either both odd or both even. There are two players named black and red, who alternate turns beginning with black. Initially, each player starts with twelve pawns: black pawns occupy the first three rows on the board's bottom side, placed on alternating squares starting at (1,1), (3,1), (5,1), (7,1) for the first row, similarly for the next two rows; red pawns are arranged similarly on the top three rows (rows 6 to 8) in a mirrored fashion. The game state tracks the location of each pawn, the number of captures for each player starting at zero, which player's turn it is (black to start), and a step counter beginning at one.

Players take turns controlling their own pawns by either moving or jumping. On their turn, a player may perform one action: move, jump, or noop. A noop action is allowed only when it is not that player's turn, effectively meaning a player can only act when they have control. Moves involve moving a pawn diagonally forward by one square onto an empty cell. For black pawns, this means moving one square diagonally upward (increasing y coordinate by 1 and x coordinate by ±1), and for red pawns, moving diagonally downward (decreasing y coordinate by 1 and changing x coordinate by ±1). Jumps are special moves where a pawn leaps over an opponent's adjacent pawn onto the empty cell immediately beyond it in the same diagonal direction. For black pawns, jumps are performed diagonally upward over red pawns; for red pawns, jumps are diagonally downward over black pawns. Jumps require that the intermediate cell between the start and landing positions is occupied by an opponent pawn, and the landing cell is empty. A move or jump is legal only if it is the current player's turn, the pawn being moved or jumped belongs to that player, the destination cell is empty, and no jump is currently available for the player (moves are only allowed if no jumps are possible). If the player has any jump moves available, they must choose a jump instead of a move. Each action is described by the player specifying coordinates for the start and end cells.

Upon performing a move or jump, the pawn's location updates to the destination cell. For jumps, the captured opponent pawn situated between the start and landing cells is removed from the board, and the player's capture count increments by one. The control switches to the other player after each action, and the step counter increments by one. Pawns cannot move outside the board boundaries; all coordinates must be between 1 and 8. Two pawns cannot occupy the same cell simultaneously. The game ends if either player has no pawns left on the board, or if the player whose turn it is cannot make any moves or jumps, or if 100 steps have been reached. At termination, the players’ scores are calculated based on the number of opponent pawns they have captured, mapped to a scoring scale where each capture corresponds to a certain point value from zero to one hundred. The player with the higher score wins. This game thus models a simplified version of checkers or draughts, emphasizing diagonal moves and compulsory capturing through jumps.
