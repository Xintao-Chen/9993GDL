The game takes place on a 6-by-6 grid defined by rows numbered 1 through 6 and columns numbered 1 through 6, where each cell may hold either a blank value or a number between 1 and 5 initially placed in some cells. The single player, identified as "robot," acts alone and takes turns placing numbers into blank cells or choosing to quit; the player may perform exactly one action per turn. The initial state features specific numbers placed at certain cells—number 5 at row 1 column 1, number 3 at row 3 column 6, and number 3 at row 5 column 2—with all other cells initially blank. On each turn, the robot can legally place a number into a blank cell provided that the placement does not violate any constraints that make it illegal: the number must not already appear in the same row or column, and it must respect a set of specified pairwise inequalities between cells, where some cells must hold numbers greater than or less than numbers in designated neighboring cells either to the right or below. The robot may also elect to quit at any time, which immediately ends the game. Actions are represented in the form "place row column number" or "quit," and placing a number updates the state by setting that cell to the chosen number while leaving all other cells unchanged; quitting sets the finished flag true. No operation or noop moves other than quitting are possible. The board boundaries implicitly restrict positions to valid rows and columns from 1 to 6, and no two cells in the same row or column can contain the same number. The constraints enforce ordering relationships between pairs of neighboring cells, requiring that one cell's number is strictly greater or less than the other's as specified. The game ends terminally either when no blank cells remain (the board is filled) or when the robot chooses to quit. The scoring system assigns zero points if any blank cells remain at termination, and a perfect score of 100 points if the robot fills all cells without violating the constraints. Thus, success requires the robot to fill the entire board with numbers respecting all uniqueness and inequality constraints or to quit early, with the latter yielding no points.
