The game is set on a three-dimensional grid consisting of three layers, each layer composed of a 3x3 board, creating a total of 27 cells indexed by four coordinates: the first two coordinates (i and j) designate the layer (each ranging from 1 to 3), and the last two coordinates (k and l) designate the row and column within that layer (also each ranging from 1 to 3). There is a single player role named "robot" who takes turns performing actions; since there is only one role, the turn order is straightforward with the robot acting each turn. The initial state of the game involves certain cells pre-filled with digits from 1 to 9, while other cells are marked as blank, represented by "b". On each turn, the robot may choose to place a digit from 1 to 9 into any blank cell on the grid, with the action formatted as "mark i j k l x," where i, j, k, and l specify the cell coordinates, and x is the digit to place. Such an action is legal only if the target cell is currently blank and if the digit to be placed does not already appear in the corresponding row k, the column l, or the 3x3 square within the specific layer i and block j, reflecting traditional Sudoku constraints extended into three dimensions. The game maintains these constraints by checking all cells within the same rows, columns, and squares across the layers to prevent duplicate digits. When the robot executes a legal mark action, the state updates by placing the specified digit in the chosen cell, replacing the blank. No explicit noop action is described, but the game terminates automatically when no legal moves remain, meaning there are no blank cells where a digit can be legally placed under the Sudoku rules. The terminal condition occurs when the puzzle is either fully and correctly filled or no valid moves are left. The scoring system awards the robot a goal value of 100 if the puzzle is completely filled with no blanks remaining (indicating successful completion) and 0 otherwise. Implicit constraints include the boundaries of the board, with indices strictly ranging from 1 to 3 for all dimensions, and the occupancy rule that a digit may only be placed in a currently blank cell. This game thus models a three-dimensional Sudoku puzzle where the single player sequentially fills in blank cells with digits, adhering to the standard Sudoku rules extended across multiple layers, aiming to complete the puzzle correctly to achieve victory.
