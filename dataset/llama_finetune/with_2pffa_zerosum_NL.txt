This is a two-player game played on a 7x7 board with coordinates ranging from 1 to 7 on both the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) axes, but with the outermost rows and columns (1 and 7) excluded from play, effectively restricting moves to the inner 5x5 area where both x and y coordinates are not equal to 1 or 7. The two players are designated as red and blue, with red taking the first turn. Initially, the red player controls the game, and each player has a single piece placed at fixed starting positions: the red piece is located at coordinate (1,4) and the blue piece at coordinate (7,4), though these positions fall outside the playable inner area, indicating that pieces spawn there but moves occur within the inner board. The game proceeds in alternating turns controlled by the players in rotation, with control passing from red to blue and vice versa after each move. On a player's turn, they may either perform a move or, if no legal moves are available, pass by performing a noop action; however, noop is only legal if it is not that player’s turn to move or if the player cannot make any legal moves during their turn.

Moves are specified by four integers indicating the piece’s starting coordinates (x1, y1) and ending coordinates (x2, y2). A move is legal if the player controls the turn, the piece to be moved belongs to the player, and the destination cell is either occupied by an opponent's piece or is an unoccupied cell within the playable area. Movement can be orthogonal (one step up, down, left, or right), diagonal (one step diagonally), or in an L-shaped pattern resembling a knight's move in chess (two steps along one axis and one step along the other). Moves must stay strictly within the board boundaries, avoiding the outermost rows and columns. A player may capture an opponent’s piece by moving into its occupied cell; this action increases that player’s capture count by one. The game state updates automatically after each move: the piece is moved to its new location, the control passes to the opposing player, the step counter increments by one, and if a capture occurred, the capturing player's count increases accordingly. The game keeps track of the number of steps taken, starting at step one and ending when step 31 is reached, which triggers the terminal state and concludes the game.

A player’s goal is to maximize their capture count by the end of the game. Victory is awarded to the player with the higher capture count, granting that player a score of 100, while the opponent receives zero. If both players have equal capture counts at the end, both receive a score of 50, indicating a draw. Implicit constraints enforce that pieces cannot occupy the same cell simultaneously except when capturing occurs, and moves must conform to the allowed movement patterns while staying within the inner playable board. The game thus involves strategic movement and capturing with a limited number of steps, alternating turns between red and blue, aiming to outcapture the opponent before the 31st step ends the play.
