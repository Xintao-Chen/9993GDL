The game is played on a 3-by-3 grid with coordinates along the x-axis numbered 1 to 3 and similarly along the y-axis numbered 1 to 3, establishing a Cartesian coordinate system for referencing each of the nine cells. There are two player roles, designated as "x" and "o," who alternate turns in a sequence governed by the game's stage and control state. Initially, all cells are blank, each player starts with three coins, and the tiebreaker advantage is assigned to player "x." The game begins in the "bidding" stage, during which players make bids to determine who gains control for marking cells. On a player's turn in the bidding stage, they may place a bid using some or all of their available coins, optionally indicating whether they use the tiebreaker advantage. The legality of a bid requires that the player has enough coins to cover the bid amount and that the tiebreaker usage aligns with current possession; only the player holding the tiebreaker may use it in their bid. If a player does not have control, they may perform a no-operation (noop) action, effectively passing their turn. After bidding concludes with a winner determined either by the highest bid or by usage of the tiebreaker, control passes to the winning player, who then may mark one of the blank cells on the board with their symbol during the marking stage. Marking is only legal if the chosen cell is blank and the player has control. When a player marks a cell, that cell's state updates to reflect the player's symbol; other cells remain unchanged unless acted upon. The game's state transitions include updating coin counts to reflect bids made, transferring tiebreaker possession if used, and changing control and stage accordingly to alternate between bidding and marking phases. Implicit constraints include restricting bids to the player's current coin total, ensuring marks occur only on empty cells within the 3-by-3 grid, and forbidding moves by non-controlling players except for noops. The game terminates when a player achieves a three-in-a-row line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when no blank cells remain on the board. Victory is awarded to the player who successfully forms such a line, granting them a score of 100, while the opponent receives zero. If neither player achieves a line by the end of the game, both players receive a score of 50, indicating a draw. Thus, the game combines strategic bidding for control with tactical placement on a classic tic-tac-toe board, with the added complexity of resource management through coin bids and tiebreaker usage determining turn order and move privileges.
