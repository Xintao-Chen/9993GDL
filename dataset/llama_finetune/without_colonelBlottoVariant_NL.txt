This game involves two players, white and black, who take alternating turns in a competitive environment defined by a simple numeric coordinate system representing counts from zero to a maximum of one hundred, though the coordinates serve primarily as numerical indices rather than spatial positions. The initial state sets both white and black players with a score of zero and twenty armies each, with the game round counter starting at zero and a maximum of ten rounds allowed. On each turn, players simultaneously select an action to commit a certain number of their armies, specified as an integer between zero and their current army count, reflecting the amount of forces they choose to deploy or stake that round. The legality of an action depends on the player having at least as many armies as they intend to commit, ensuring actions cannot exceed available resources. Noop actions are implicitly represented by committing zero armies, allowing players to pass or refrain from increasing their stake. After both players commit their armies for the round, the game state updates by incrementing the round count by one, adding the committed armies to each player's total armies, and updating each player's score based on the outcome of that round. The scoring mechanism awards two points to the player who commits more armies in a round, zero points to the player who commits fewer, and one point each if both commit equal amounts, reflecting a direct comparison of commitment sizes. This process repeats until the rounds counter reaches the maximum number of ten, at which point the game terminates. Throughout gameplay, implicit constraints ensure that army commitments do not surpass the players' current armies and that the rounds progress sequentially without skipping. The final victory criteria are based on the accumulated scores: each playerâ€™s goal value equals their total score, and the player with the higher cumulative points after ten rounds is considered the winner. The game thus models a strategic bidding contest where players balance preserving their armies and maximizing their score over a fixed number of rounds, with all actions and state changes governed by straightforward arithmetic and turn-based updates.
