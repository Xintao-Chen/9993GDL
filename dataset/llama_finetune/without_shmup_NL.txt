The game takes place on a board with coordinates labeled from 1 to 8 arranged in a circular manner where each index is adjacent to the next, and 8 loops back to 1, creating a wrap-around effect for both rows and columns. There are two players, Light and Dark, each controlling a single ship initially placed at coordinates (3,3) for Light and (6,6) for Dark. The game progresses in alternating turns split into two phases: a "fire" phase and a "move" phase. Initially, the game starts in the "fire" phase, and on each turn, only one player acts, alternating between Light and Dark. During the firing phase, a player may choose to fire a bullet in one of eight compass directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW). During the moving phase, a player may either move their ship one step in any of these eight directions or pass by performing a noop action; however, moving is only legal if the destination square is not occupied by a bullet traveling in the opposite direction of the intended movement. The turn automatically switches from the firing phase to the moving phase and back after each action, ensuring players alternate between firing and moving each turn. Ships and bullets move according to directional rules that wrap around the board edges, maintaining the circular coordinate system. Movement of ships is constrained so that ships cannot move into squares threatened by opposing bullets, and ships cannot occupy the same square simultaneously; if they do, both ships are considered destroyed. Firing creates a bullet that appears adjacent to the firing ship in the chosen direction and continues moving forward in subsequent turns until it either destroys a ship by occupying the same square or the game ends otherwise. A ship is destroyed if it occupies the same coordinate as a bullet or if both ships end up on the same square. The game ends when either ship is destroyed. Scoring depends on the final state: if one player's ship is destroyed and the other survives, the surviving player scores 100 points and the destroyed player scores zero. If both ships are destroyed simultaneously, both players score 50 points. If neither ship is destroyed by the end of play, both players also score 50 points. The coordinate system's adjacency and directional movement rules ensure that all moves and shots respect the circular board layout, and implicit constraints prevent ships from moving into bullets coming from the opposite direction or overlapping each other except when destruction occurs. Thus, the game revolves around strategic firing and movement within a limited and cyclic 8x8 coordinate space, with players alternating firing and moving actions to outmaneuver and eliminate their opponent's ship.
