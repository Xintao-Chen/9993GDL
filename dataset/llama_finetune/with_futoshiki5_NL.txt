The game is played on a 5-by-5 grid with coordinates specified by row and column indices ranging from 1 to 5, where each cell can hold either a number or be blank. There is a single player role named "robot" who takes turns placing numbers on the board or choosing to quit. The initial state places the number 5 in cell (1,1), the number 3 in cell (5,2), and all other cells are blank. On each turn, the robot may perform one action, which is either placing a number in an empty cell or quitting the game; placing a number is only legal if the chosen cell is blank and the number does not violate any constraints that disallow duplicate numbers in the same row or column, or violate specified greater-than relationships between certain pairs of cells. The action format for placing a number is to specify the row, column, and number, while quitting is a separate action without parameters. When a number is placed, that cell's state changes from blank to the placed number, and all other cells remain as they were except the newly placed cell; if the robot quits, the game transitions to a finished state. The game enforces implicit constraints that no number may appear more than once in any row or column, and that certain specified pairs of cells must satisfy strict greater-than inequalities according to predefined constraints between adjacent or related cells, effectively limiting the values that can be assigned to maintain the ordering. The game ends either when the board is completely filled with numbers, or when the robot chooses to quit, marking the terminal condition. Scoring awards the robot 100 points if the board is fully filled without any blanks remaining; otherwise, if any blank cells remain at termination, the robot scores zero. Thus, the objective is for the robot to fill the board with numbers obeying the uniqueness and inequality constraints to achieve a fully completed grid and secure the maximum score.
