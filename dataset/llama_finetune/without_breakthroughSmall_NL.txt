The game is played on a grid with coordinates ranging from 1 to 6 along both the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) axes, forming a 6-by-6 board. There are two players, designated as white and black, who alternate turns starting with white. Initially, the white player’s pieces occupy all cells in the first and second rows (y=1 and y=2), while the black player’s pieces occupy all cells in the fifth and sixth rows (y=5 and y=6). On a player's turn, they may move one of their own pieces according to specific movement rules or choose to take no action (noop) if it is not their turn. White pieces move forward by increasing their y-coordinate by one, while black pieces move forward by decreasing their y-coordinate by one, reflecting their opposing directions. Moves may be directly forward in the same column into an empty cell or diagonally forward by one column to the left or right, provided the destination cell is not occupied by a piece of the same color. The movement must respect board boundaries and cannot land on a cell occupied by a friendly piece; however, moving into a cell occupied by an opposing piece is not allowed either, as indicated by the move legality conditions. If a player is not in control (i.e., it is the opponent’s turn), their only legal action is noop, effectively passing the turn. After a legal move, the piece relocates to the new cell, and the previous cell becomes empty, with control passing to the opposing player. The game ends when either a white piece reaches any cell in the topmost row (y=6), or a black piece reaches any cell in the bottom row (y=1), or when one player has no pieces remaining on the board. Victory is awarded to the player who achieves these conditions, granting them a full score of 100, while the opponent receives zero. Thus, the game revolves around advancing pieces forward into the opponent’s territory without violating movement constraints, with the objective of either reaching the opponent’s baseline first or completely eliminating the opponent’s pieces.
