The game is played between two players, white and black, each taking turns in a simultaneous manner, where both players commit a certain number of armies at each step. The environment does not have a spatial coordinate system or board layout; rather, it operates on a numerical scale from 0 to 20 representing the armies each player has available to commit. Initially, both players start with a score of zero and 20 armies each. On every turn, both players simultaneously select a non-negative integer action named 'commit' that must not exceed the number of armies they currently have. The action format requires that the committed number be less than or equal to the player's current army count, ensuring no overcommitment. After both players commit their armies, the game updates the scores and armies: each player's score increases by a value dependent on whether their committed armies exceed the opponent's commitment, with a differential scoring mechanism awarding 5 points to the player who commits more armies in that turn or 1 point each if they commit equal amounts; the armies are then summed with the committed amounts, effectively replenishing them, which suggests a conceptual accumulation rather than depletion of armies, although the logic is somewhat atypical. The game continues until both players simultaneously commit zero armies, which triggers the finished state and ends the game. Throughout the game, commitment values must be within the integer range from 0 to 20, and no spatial positioning or occupancy conflicts exist since the game mechanics revolve solely around numerical commitments and score tracking. The terminal condition is reached when both players choose to commit zero, signaling the end of the game. The final scores for both players are their accumulated points from previous turns, with the player holding the higher score considered the winner. This game does not include a traditional noop move; however, committing zero armies effectively serves as a no-operation action that can lead to the game's termination when chosen by both players simultaneously.
