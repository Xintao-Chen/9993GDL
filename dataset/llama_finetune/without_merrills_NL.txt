The game is played on a board consisting of three concentric squares labeled as inner, middle, and outer, each having eight positions identified by directional coordinates: north (n), northeast (ne), east (e), southeast (se), south (s), southwest (sw), west (w), and northwest (nw). These positions form the pits where stones can be placed or moved. The coordinate system is thus a combination of the square label and the direction, such as "outer n" or "middle se." Two players participate, designated as white and black, taking alternate turns with white moving first. Initially, each player has nine stones in their reserve (heap), and all pits on the board are empty. The game state also keeps track of the current step number, starting at zero, and which player has control to act.

During a turn, the player in control may perform one of several actions or choose to do nothing (noop) under certain conditions. Actions include placing a stone from their heap onto an empty pit, moving a stone they already have on the board to an adjacent empty pit, or removing an opponent's stone from the board if a mill has just been formed. Placing is only legal if the player has stones remaining in their heap and the target pit is empty, and moving is allowed only if the player has no stones left in their heap, the stone to move belongs to them, and the destination pit is empty and adjacent to the origin pit. However, if a player has exactly three stones remaining on the board, they are allowed to move a stone to any empty pit without adjacency restrictions. Noop moves are legal when it is the opponent's turn, or when a mill has been formed but there are no opponent stones eligible for removal, or when the player has no legal moves left and no stones to place.

After a player places a stone, their heap count decreases by one, and the pit at the specified coordinates becomes occupied by their stone. When moving a stone, the origin pit becomes empty, and the destination pit is occupied by the player's stone. Removing an opponent's stone frees the corresponding pit. The turn control switches to the other player unless the current player has just formed a mill, in which case they maintain control to remove an opponent's stone. The step counter increments by one after each move. A mill is defined as three stones of the same player aligned either along the same square at consecutive directions or along the same direction across all three squares, with special treatment for corner directions. Stones that form part of a mill cannot be removed by the opponent.

The game concludes either when a player has fewer than three stones on the board, when both players have no stones left in their heaps, or when 60 steps have elapsed. The scoring system awards 100 points to a player who reduces the opponent to fewer than three stones, 75 points if they have more stones than the opponent but neither is below three, 25 points if they have fewer stones but both have at least three, and zero points if they themselves fall below three. If the game ends by reaching the step limit without a decisive stone count difference, both players receive 50 points. The objective is to strategically place and move stones to form mills, remove opponent stones, and maintain at least three stones on the board while preventing the opponent from doing the same.
