The game is played on a rectangular grid with rows labeled from r1 to r7 and columns labeled from c1 to c7, though not all cells in this range are part of the boardâ€”specifically, the first row lacks a c1 column and the last row lacks a c1 column as well, creating an irregular board shape. Each cell can be in one of three states: occupied by player X's piece, occupied by player O's piece, or blank (empty). The coordinate system is defined by these row and column labels, with adjacency relationships established between consecutive rows and columns for navigation and pattern recognition. There are two players, identified as X and O, who alternate turns with player X moving first as indicated by the initial control state.

At the start, each player has a certain number of "quad" tokens (12 each) and "white" tokens (5 each), though the exact function of these tokens relates to the legality of specific actions. The board's initial state has all specified cells empty. On a player's turn, they may choose one of two possible actions: a "mark" action or a "block" action. A "mark" action places the player's own piece on an empty cell, while a "block" action places a white token on an empty cell, which presumably blocks or protects that cell from certain effects. Importantly, for a "mark" action to be legal, the targeted cell must be empty and it must be that player's turn to move; for a "block" action to be legal, the targeted cell must be empty, it must be that player's turn, and the player must have at least one white token remaining (i.e., their white token count is not zero). Players can also choose to perform a noop (no operation) action, but only when it is the opponent's turn, effectively passing the move or waiting. After each "mark" action, the player's quad token count decreases by one, and after each "block" action, the player's white token count decreases by one. The control of the turn passes to the other player after a "mark" action; however, after a "block" action, the current player retains control for another action, allowing for multiple blocks in succession before the turn switches.

Cells marked by a player remain occupied by that player in the next state, while cells where a block was placed become white and remain so. The board enforces occupancy conflicts such that a cell cannot be marked or blocked if it is already occupied or blocked. The board boundaries are implicitly respected, as actions targeting non-existent cells or cells outside the defined board are not legal. The game recognizes "squares" consisting of four cells arranged in a rectangular shape by checking adjacency relationships among rows and columns, enabling the detection of specific patterns on the board.

The terminal conditions for the game are met if either player forms a "win" pattern, defined as a square of four cells all occupied by that player's pieces; a "lose" pattern, where the opponent forms such a square; or if there are no more "open" quads left, meaning no player has any quad tokens remaining. Additionally, the game may end if no further actions are possible. The victory criteria are based on these terminal conditions and the count of white tokens remaining for each player. Player X wins outright with a "win" pattern and scores 100 points, or scores 95 points if winning by an "open quad," which is a nearly complete square missing one piece or blocked cell. If neither player has won or lost and no open quads remain, the player with more white tokens scores 90 points, equal white tokens yield 50 points, and fewer white tokens yield 10 points for player X. Player X loses outright if player O forms a winning square, scoring 0 points. Conversely, player O scores 100 points if player X loses, 90 points if having fewer white tokens in a neutral state, 50 points with equal white tokens, 10 points with more white tokens, and 5 points when winning by an open quad, scoring 0 points if player X has a winning square. This scoring system encourages strategic placement of marks and blocks to form squares while managing the white tokens and quad tokens resources carefully. The game proceeds with players alternating turns, performing legal actions that modify the board state and their resource counts, until a terminal condition is met and final scores are assigned accordingly.
