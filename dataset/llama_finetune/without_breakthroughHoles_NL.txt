This game is played on an 8-by-8 grid with coordinates ranging from 1 to 8 along both the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) axes. The game features two players: White and Black, who alternate turns starting with White. Initially, White pieces occupy all cells in the first two rows, specifically rows 1 and 2 across all columns from 1 to 8, while Black pieces occupy all cells in the last two rows, rows 7 and 8, similarly across all columns. Certain cells at coordinates (3,3), (3,6), (6,3), and (6,6) are designated as holes and are off-limits to any piece throughout the game. On a player’s turn, they may either move one of their pieces or pass with a noop action, but a player can only pass when it is not their turn, effectively enforcing that only the player currently in control can make a move; otherwise, noop is the only legal action. Moves involve shifting a piece one step forward or diagonally forward by one cell: for White, forward means increasing the row number by one; for Black, forward means decreasing the row number by one. A piece can move straight forward into an empty cell or diagonally forward to capture an opponent’s piece, provided the destination is not occupied by a friendly piece and is not an off-limits hole cell. Moves that would place a piece outside the board boundaries, onto a hole cell, or onto a cell occupied by the player’s own piece are illegal. The game automatically updates the board state by moving the chosen piece to the new cell and removing it from its former location, while all hole cells remain permanently off-limits. After each move, control passes to the opposing player. The game ends when a White piece reaches the back row of the Black side (row 8), when a Black piece reaches the back row of the White side (row 1), or when one player has no remaining pieces on the board. Upon termination, if White has won, White receives 100 points and Black 0; if Black has won, Black receives 100 points and White 0. The primary objective for each player is to either advance a piece to the opponent’s home row or eliminate all opposing pieces to secure victory.
