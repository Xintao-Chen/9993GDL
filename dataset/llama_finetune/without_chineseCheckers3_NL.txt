This game is played on a board consisting of a set of uniquely indexed cells arranged in a specific pattern defined by indices a1 through i1, forming rows of varying lengths and a coordinate system based on these indices. There are three players with roles named red, green, and blue, who take turns in a fixed cyclic order: red moves first, then green, followed by blue, and then back to red. The initial state places red's pieces in cells a1, b1, and b2; blue's pieces in f1, g1, and g2; and green's pieces in f6, g6, and g7, with red having initial control of the turn and the step counter set to 1. Each turn, the player in control may make a move action or perform a no-operation (noop). A move action consists of specifying a source cell occupied by one of the player's pieces and a destination cell to move into, formatted as move b e, where b and e are cell indices. Moves are legal only if the player currently has control and the move satisfies specific movement rules based on a complex adjacency structure defined by "car" and "cdr" relations for each player, which describe allowable paths on the board. These relations encode connections between cells in terms of directional edges, and legal moves require that the source cell is occupied by the player's piece, and the destination cell is empty, following a path of occupied and empty intermediate cells according to the move patterns defined, including straight and jump moves over occupied cells. The player may also choose noop at any time, which is always legal and results in no change of piece positions. When a move is executed, the piece moves from the source cell to the destination cell, and the source cell becomes empty in the next state, while any other cells not affected by the move retain their current occupancy. Control passes automatically to the next player in the sequence after each turn, and the step count increments by one. The game's spatial constraints include that pieces must remain within the defined board cells, cannot move into occupied cells, and must follow the complex adjacency and movement rules specific to each player’s movement graph. The game ends either when the step count reaches 60 or when any player achieves a scoring condition of 100 stones. Scoring is calculated based on particular triads of cells assigned to each player: for red, the cells h1, h2, and i1; for green, c1, c2, and d1; and for blue, c6, c7, and d6. Each player’s score depends on the occupancy of their three associated cells, with full control of all three cells awarding 100 points, two occupied cells granting 50 points, one occupied cell giving 25 points, and none yielding zero. The game terminates immediately if any player reaches the maximum score of 100 stones, declaring that player the winner, or after 60 steps if no player has achieved this, concluding the game.
