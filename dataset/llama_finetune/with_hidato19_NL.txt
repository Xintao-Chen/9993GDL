The game is played on a board consisting of a set of coordinates arranged in a grid with labeled cells such as a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3, b4, c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, d1, d2, d3, d4, e1, e2, and e3, where adjacency between cells is defined both horizontally, vertically, and diagonally according to specified adjacency relations. The environment uses a coordinate system where each cell may be either blank or occupied by a number from 1 to 19, with an initial state placing certain numbers in specific cells and others left blank. There is a single player role called "robot," which takes turns performing actions in a sequence that continues until the game reaches a terminal state. On each turn, the robot may either place a number in a blank cell or choose to quit. The no-operation (noop) mechanism is represented by the "quit" action, which ends the game and triggers the terminal condition. Each action by the robot must be legal, and a placement action is legal only if it places an unused number into a currently blank cell, where this number must be consecutive to numbers already on the board and must be positioned in a cell that is either adjacent or absent relative to the cells containing the predecessor and successor numbers, ensuring a continuous sequence. Specifically, the number to place must be such that there exists a predecessor number one less and a successor number one greater, and these numbers must either be unused or occupy cells adjacent to the target cell, maintaining a proximity constraint around the placement. The state updates after each action include marking the chosen cell with the newly placed number and marking that number as used, while all other cells remain unchanged unless the robot quits, which triggers the finished state. The implicit constraints enforce that numbers must be placed within the boundaries of the defined board coordinates, maintaining adjacency rules and preventing overlapping, as only blank cells may receive new numbers. The game terminates either when all cells are filled with numbers or when the robot decides to quit voluntarily. The scoring system awards the robot zero points if there remain any blank cells at the end of the game, and 100 points if the board is entirely filled, reflecting successful completion. Thus, the game challenges the robot to place numbers in a consecutive sequence across the board's cells, respecting adjacency and occupancy rules, until the board is fully populated or the robot opts to end the game.
