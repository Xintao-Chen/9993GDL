The game is played on a 7-by-7 grid with coordinates ranging from 1 to 7 along both axes, where the cells on the outermost rows and columns (those with coordinates 1 or 7) are excluded from play, leaving an inner 5-by-5 playable area. Three players—red, yellow, and blue—participate, taking turns in a fixed sequence: red moves first, followed by yellow, then blue, and then back to red, continuing cyclically. Initially, each player controls a single piece placed at a distinct starting position: red at cell (1,4), yellow at (4,1), and blue at (7,4). The game begins at step one, with each player's capture count set to zero. On a player's turn, they may either perform a move or pass by issuing a noop action. A move consists of relocating one of their pieces from a source cell to a target cell according to specific movement rules: the piece may move orthogonally or diagonally by one cell or in an L-shaped pattern resembling a knight's move in chess, provided the destination cell is either occupied by an opponent's piece (allowing a capture) or is an empty cell in the case of the L-shaped move. Moves are only legal if the player controls the piece at the source cell, the target cell lies within the playable board boundaries, and the target is either unoccupied or occupied by a different player’s piece. If a player has no legal moves available, they must perform a noop. After a move, the player's control passes to the next player in the rotation sequence. When a piece moves onto a cell occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is captured, incrementing the capturing player's capture count by one. The board state updates accordingly, with the moved piece occupying the new cell and the captured piece removed. The game continues incrementing the step count with each turn, and the game terminates automatically after 31 steps have been completed. Scoring is based solely on the number of captures made by each player, with higher capture counts translating to higher scores through a linear mapping where 0 captures equal 0 points and 10 captures equal 100 points. The ultimate victory condition is determined by these scores at the game's end. Implicit constraints ensure that no piece can occupy the same cell as another piece of the same player, and all moves must stay within the inner 5-by-5 board area defined by excluding the outermost rows and columns. The game enforces orderly turn progression, legal movement patterns, capture tracking, and termination after a fixed number of turns, culminating in a victory assessment based on captured pieces.
