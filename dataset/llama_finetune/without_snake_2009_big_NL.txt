The game is set on a toroidal grid with seven rows labeled r1 through r7 and eleven columns labeled c01 through c11, where rows and columns wrap around cyclically such that moving off one edge re-enters on the opposite side. Each cell in this grid can be one of several types: blank (b), wall, point, or exit. The player assumes the sole role of the snake, which occupies a position on the board defined by coordinates (column and row), along with a tail position that moves according to the snake's motion. The initial state places various cells with predefined types—most are blank, some are walls or points, and one cell is the exit—with the snake starting at position c06 r4 and its tail also at this cell, holding zero points and with the game step counter at zero. During play, the snake takes turns making moves in one of four directions: up, down, left, or right, which correspond to moving to the adjacent cell in the respective direction, with the wraparound on rows and columns ensuring continuous movement across the board edges. On each turn, the snake must choose a legal move, which is defined as moving from its current head position to a next cell that is either blank, contains a point, or is the exit, and must not be a wall; the snake cannot move into walls or invalid cells. If no legal moves are available, the game terminates. The move action updates the snake's head position to the new cell and advances the game step counter by one. The snake's tail position updates every other move, alternating based on an internal even-move flag: on moves when this flag is false, the tail position remains; when true, the tail moves forward to follow the snake's body, effectively simulating snake growth and movement. The cells update accordingly, with the previous tail cell becoming blank when the tail moves. When the snake enters a cell containing a point, it scores a point, incrementing its total points by one, and the point is considered consumed. The scoring system maps the number of points collected to a score value, increasing in discrete increments. The game terminates either when the snake reaches the exit cell, when fifty steps have elapsed, or when there are no legal moves possible. The player's goal is to maximize their score, which depends on how many points the snake has collected upon reaching the exit or before termination if the exit is not reached. Overall, the gameplay simulates navigating a snake through a grid with obstacles and collectible points, moving stepwise with turn-based control, wrapping around the grid edges, and tracking growth and scoring until a terminal condition ends the game.
