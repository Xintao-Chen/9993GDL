This game involves two players, designated as white and black, who alternate turns making moves within a maximum of 20 rounds, with the round count starting at zero. The game does not specify a spatial environment or coordinate system beyond the progression of rounds and scores. At the beginning, both players have a score of zero, and the round counter is set to zero. On each turn, both players simultaneously choose one of two possible actions: "straight" or "swerve." These actions are legal as long as the current round number is less than the maximum of 20 rounds. The game advances the round count by one after each set of moves. The players’ scores change depending on the combination of their chosen actions in that round: if white goes straight while black swerves, white’s score increases by five and black’s by three; if black goes straight while white swerves, black’s score increases by five and white’s by three; if both swerve, both players gain four points; if both go straight, no scores change. The scoring increments occur only when the appropriate combinations of moves are made, and the scores never decrease. The game ends automatically when the round count reaches 20. At termination, each player’s goal value equals their final score, which serves as the victory criterion. There is no explicit mention of a spatial board, coordinates, or occupancy conflicts, and no "noop" or no-operation move is defined. The implicit constraints are that the game proceeds sequentially through rounds up to the maximum, moves must be chosen from the two specified actions, and scores update strictly according to the action combinations described. The player roles take turns simultaneously each round, and the game’s state consists solely of the current round and each player’s score, which evolve deterministically based on the players’ moves until the maximum rounds are reached and the final scores determine the outcome.
