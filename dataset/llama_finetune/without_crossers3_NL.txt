This game is played on a coordinate grid with nine columns and nine rows labeled c1 through c9, establishing a two-dimensional environment where positions and movements are defined by these coordinates. The game features three players, designated as top, right, and left, who take turns in an order implied by the roles listed. Initially, the top player starts at position c1 c1, the right player at c9 c9, and the left player at c1 c9. The board contains fixed walls placed between certain coordinate pairs, which act as barriers blocking movement between adjacent positions. On each turn, a player may either move or perform a noop (no operation). Movement actions are formatted as "go" followed by target coordinates and are only legal if the player is not currently at their goal position, the intended move leads to a possible next position based on allowed directional moves specific to each player, the path is not blocked by walls, and the move does not result in collisions with other players who might be moving into the same position simultaneously. If a player has reached their goal position or has no legal moves available, they must choose noop. Legal moves for each player differ: the top player can move left, right, down-left, or down-right; the right player can move up-right, down-left, up-left, or left; and the left player can move down-right, up-left, right, or up-right. Movement between coordinates respects adjacency relations defined by successor functions on coordinate labels, ensuring players move to adjacent squares only. When a move is executed without collision, the player's position updates to the new coordinates; if a collision occurs, the player's position remains the same. Walls can dynamically reorder based on player movement to maintain accurate blockage relations. The game tracks steps to goal for each player, incrementing the counter when a player moves closer to their goal without collision. The terminal conditions for the game are triggered when no player can perform a legal move or when the step count reaches 30. Victory scoring is determined by goal position reach and the number of steps taken: if only one player reaches their goal, their score depends on their steps relative to thresholds; if two players reach their goals, scores are assigned based on comparative steps; if all three reach their goals, scores depend on their relative steps to goal, with better performance rewarded higher. Players who fail to reach their goals receive low or zero scores. Implicit constraints in the game include the bounding of movements within the coordinate grid c1 to c9, prevention of movement through walls or onto occupied spaces causing collision, and adjacency requirements for valid moves. The goal positions for each player are defined as the last column for top (any coordinate c9), the first column for right (coordinate c1), and the diagonal positions for left (coordinates where column and row labels are equal). Overall, the game challenges players to navigate the board efficiently toward their respective goals while avoiding collisions and respecting walls, with scoring rewarding speed and successful goal attainment under the given constraints.
