The game is played on a board composed of 37 distinct positions labeled from a1 through i1, arranged in an irregular grid where some rows have varying numbers of positions, creating a unique topology defined by adjacency relations. The coordinate system consists of these named positions rather than numeric coordinates, with explicit connections between them indicated by two types of directional links, termed "car" and "cdr," which differ depending on the player's perspective (red or teal), effectively defining the neighbors and available movement paths on the board. There are two player roles, red and teal, who alternate turns starting with red as the initial controller; the initial state places red's pieces on positions a1, b1, and b2, and teal's pieces on h1, h2, and i1, with the game beginning at step 1. On each turn, the player in control may either move a piece or pass by performing a noop action, which is always legal for any role. A move action is specified by indicating the source position and the target position to which a piece is to be moved; such moves are legal only if the player controls the source cell and the move satisfies the game's movement rules. Movement legality requires a particular pattern of occupancy and adjacency: a piece may move to an empty cell reachable by traversing a chain of occupied and empty cells along the "car" and "cdr" adjacency relations in sequences of one to four steps, with the exact pattern depending on the configuration of occupied and empty positions along the path; this complex condition ensures that moves correspond to jumping over or sliding past other pieces in prescribed ways. When a move is made from a source to a target cell, the piece relocates accordingly, the source cell becomes empty, and the next player gains control for the subsequent turn, with the step count incremented by one each turn. Occupancy of cells is mutually exclusive: a position may be occupied by at most one piece at a time, and moves must remain within the bounds of the defined board positions and adjacency links. The game terminates either when a player reaches a full "stone" count of 100 points, which occurs if that player occupies all three special counting positions assigned to their opponent's side, or when the step count reaches 40, whichever happens first. Scoring is determined by counting the player's occupancy among three designated positions on the opponent's side of the board: if all three are occupied by the player, they earn 100 points; if two are occupied, they earn 50 points; if only one is occupied, they earn 25 points; and if none are occupied, they earn zero. The goal for each player is to maximize their stone count, with the game ending immediately if a player attains the maximum score of 100. Thus, the game challenges players to maneuver their pieces strategically across the board's complex adjacency structure to occupy key opponent positions efficiently within a limited number of turns, alternating moves or passing as needed.
