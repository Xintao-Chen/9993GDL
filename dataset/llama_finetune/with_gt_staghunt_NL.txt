The game is played between two players, designated as white and black, who alternate turns selecting actions simultaneously during each round. The game is structured to last up to a maximum of 20 rounds, with the round count starting at zero and incrementing by one each turn until the terminal round is reached, marking the end of the game. At the start, both players’ scores are initialized to zero, and the round counter is set to zero. On each turn, both players independently choose one of two possible actions: "stag" or "hare." These choices constitute the legal moves available to each player at any round before the maximum number of rounds is reached; once round 20 is reached, no further moves are allowed and the game terminates. There is no explicit "noop" action mentioned, so players must always select either "stag" or "hare" each turn. The actions are represented by the player’s color followed by their chosen move, for example "white stag" or "black hare." The legality of a move depends solely on the current round being less than the maximum allowed rounds. After both players have acted, the round counter increments by one, and the scores update according to the combination of moves chosen: if both players choose "stag," each player’s score increases by 5 points; if one player chooses "stag" while the other chooses "hare," the player choosing "stag" gains no points while the player choosing "hare" gains 2 points; if both players choose "hare," each gains 2 points. The game board or environment does not have any spatial or coordinate system elements or constraints, nor are there occupancy conflicts or distance relationships to consider, as the game is purely based on simultaneous action selection and score accumulation. The game concludes when the maximum round count of 20 is reached, at which point the player with the higher score is deemed the winner. The final score values of each player are used directly as their goals, reflecting the outcome of the game.
