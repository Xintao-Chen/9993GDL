The game is played on a 9-by-9 grid, with rows and columns indexed from 1 to 9, forming the coordinate system for the board. There is a single player role called sudokuPlayer who takes turns sequentially to place marks on the board. The initial state consists of some cells possibly already marked with numbers from 1 to 9, while the rest are empty. On each turn, the sudokuPlayer must perform exactly one action of placing a valid mark—an integer from 1 to 9—into an empty cell identified by its row and column coordinates. This action is legal only if the chosen cell is currently empty, meaning it has no mark assigned yet. There is no explicit noop or pass action; the player must make a move by filling an empty cell on every turn. Each action updates the state by marking the specified cell with the chosen number, and all previously placed marks persist unchanged. Implicit constraints of the game include that all moves must remain within the 9-by-9 board boundaries, and no cell may be marked more than once. The game's progression continues until there are no empty cells left on the board, at which point the game reaches a terminal state. Victory is achieved if the completed board satisfies Sudoku rules: every row, every column, and each of the nine distinct 3-by-3 sub-squares must contain each digit from 1 through 9 exactly once. If these conditions hold, the player receives a goal value of 100, indicating a win; otherwise, the goal value is 0. Thus, the game is a solitary puzzle where the player sequentially fills the board according to Sudoku rules, aiming to produce a fully completed and valid Sudoku solution by the time all cells are filled.
