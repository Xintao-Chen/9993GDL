The game takes place on two separate 4-by-4 grid boards, each with coordinates ranging from 1 to 4 in both the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) directions. Each board is identified as either board 1 or board 2, and each cell within the boards can be referenced by its board number and its x and y coordinates. The game features two players with distinct roles: the "crosser" and the "blocker," who alternate turns in a fixed order. Initially, all cells on both boards are empty, marked as blank. During a turn, a player can perform a marking action where they select one cell from board 1 and one cell from board 2 simultaneously, marking the chosen cell on board 1 and the chosen cell on board 2 according to their role. For the crosser, the mark is "crosser," and for the blocker, it is "blk" (blocked). Such a marking move is only legal if the targeted cells on both boards are currently blank. The game enforces that the crosser and blocker cannot mark the same cell simultaneously; that is, the cells chosen by each player for marking must be distinct on each board. After both players have made their marking moves in a round, the game state updates accordingly: the cells marked by the blocker become blocked on the first and second boards, and the cells marked by the crosser become marked as crosser on the respective boards, except when the crosser’s cell coincides with the blocker’s marked cell, in which case the crosser’s mark does not replace the blocker’s. If a cell is neither marked by the crosser nor the blocker in a turn, it retains its previous state. The game continues until a terminal condition is met, which occurs if the crosser manages to create a continuous bridge of four connected crosser-marked cells running consecutively from the first column to the fourth column on either board 1 or board 2, or if there are no blank cells left on either board, indicating no further moves are possible. Continuity between cells is defined by adjacency in the coordinate system, where connected cells have coordinates that are consecutive either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally as specified by a continuity relation. Scoring is determined based on these terminal conditions: if the crosser succeeds in creating a bridge on both boards, the crosser scores 100 points; if a bridge is formed on only one board, the crosser scores 50 points; otherwise, the crosser scores 0. The blocker’s score is inversely related to the crosser’s success: the blocker earns 100 points if the crosser fails to form any bridge and no blank cells remain on either board, 50 points if the crosser forms a bridge on exactly one board, and 0 points if the crosser completes bridges on both boards. The game enforces implicit constraints such as the requirement that all moves occur within the bounds of the 4-by-4 grids, that each move must involve distinct cells for the crosser and blocker within the same turn, and that no overlapping markings are permitted on the same cell in a single turn. Players may choose to pass their turn by not marking new cells, effectively performing a no-operation, but the game progresses only through marking actions that adhere to the legality conditions described. The ultimate goal for the crosser is to forge uninterrupted paths of crosser marks across a board’s columns to achieve victory, while the blocker aims to prevent such paths and maintain or create blocked cells that hinder the crosser’s progress.
