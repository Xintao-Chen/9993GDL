The game is set in a two-dimensional coordinate system with discrete positions defined by integers ranging from negative values up to positive values, with a succession relation defining the ordering of these numbers. The environment includes a predefined set of valid positions or tracks on the board, which impose implicit boundaries and movement constraints. There are four players in the game, identified by the roles red, blue, green, and yellow, who take turns in an unspecified but fixed order. The initial state sets a counter to fifty and places each player at specific positions with initial velocities: yellow at position (1,0) moving at velocity (0,1), red at (2,0) with velocity (0,1), blue at (3,0) at velocity (0,1), and green at (4,0) at velocity (0,1). On each turn, a player may choose an action that either changes their velocity by at most one unit in each direction (x and y) within the permissible speed range of -8 to +8, or they may resign if no legal speed changes are available or if they have already resigned. Legal velocity changes are restricted to increments or decrements of at most one unit per axis, and the resulting position after applying the new velocity must lie on a valid track, ensuring players cannot move outside the defined paths. If a player resigns, their velocity resets to zero and their position remains unchanged. The game automatically updates each player's position by adding the current velocity components to their coordinates on the board and increments the turn counter after each player’s move. Players cannot remain stationary unless they resign; at least one component of velocity must be non-zero when changing speed. The game ends when the counter reaches fifty, when any player’s y-coordinate becomes negative (indicating they have landed), or when no players remain active (i.e., all have resigned). Scoring is based on whether players have landed within a defined landing zone, which requires their y-coordinate to be less than zero and their x-coordinate to be greater than twenty. Players who land alone in the landing zone score 100 points, those who land with others in this zone score 75 points, players still active but not landed score 25 points, and those who have resigned score zero. The game enforces that players move only along tracks marked as valid positions, preventing illegal moves and collisions. The turn control ensures that each player acts in sequence, with the noop mechanism implicitly handled by the resign action, which players can invoke if no legal speed changes exist, effectively passing their turn without movement. Thus, the game blends strategic velocity control within spatial constraints, encouraging players to maneuver towards the landing zone efficiently while managing limited turn counts and avoiding resignation.
