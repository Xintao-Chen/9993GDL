The game is played on two separate 3-by-3 grids, each with cells identified by coordinates (x, y) where x and y range from 1 to 3, forming the game environment's coordinate system. There are two players, designated as xplayer and oplayer, who alternate turns. Initially, all cells on both grids are blank. The player in control can make a move by marking one blank cell on the first grid and simultaneously marking one blank cell on the second grid with their respective symbol—'x' for xplayer and 'o' for oplayer. On a player's turn, they must specify an action of the form "mark x1 y1 x2 y2," where (x1, y1) is a blank cell on the first grid and (x2, y2) is a blank cell on the second grid; this action is legal only if the player currently controls the turn and both chosen cells are unoccupied. If it is not a player's turn, the only legal action they may take is a noop, effectively passing without altering the state. When a player marks a cell, that cell becomes occupied by their mark, while all other cells retain their previous states. Control then passes to the opposing player. The game enforces implicit constraints such that the cells chosen for marking must be distinct, and all cell coordinates must fall within the 3x3 grid boundaries. The game terminates when either player achieves a "line" on either grid—this line is defined as any complete row, column, or diagonal filled entirely with that player's mark—or when no blank cells remain on a grid, i.e., the grid is "not open." Scoring depends on the state of both grids at termination: a player scores 100 points if they have formed a line on both grids, 75 or 50 points if they have formed a line on one grid with the other grid either open or closed without a line, 25 points if neither grid contains a line but certain conditions are met, and 0 points if the opponent has formed lines or other conditions apply. Victory is determined based on these scores, rewarding players who successfully create lines on one or both grids while considering board occupancy and openness.
