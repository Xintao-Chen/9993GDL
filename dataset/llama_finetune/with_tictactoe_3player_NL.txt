The game is played on a 5-by-5 grid with coordinates labeled from 1 to 5 along both rows and columns, where each cell can be identified by its row and column indices. There are three players named xplayer, oplayer, and zplayer who take turns in a fixed cyclic order starting with xplayer, followed by oplayer, then zplayer, and repeating this sequence. Initially, all cells on the board are empty, denoted by the symbol 'b', and control is given to xplayer to make the first move. On each turn, the player in control must either place their mark—x for xplayer, o for oplayer, and z for zplayer—on any empty cell by specifying the row and column coordinates of that cell, or they may perform a no-operation (noop) action if it is not their turn. A move to mark a cell is legal only if the chosen cell is currently empty and the player is the one in control. When a player marks a cell, that cell's state updates to contain the player's symbol; all other cells remain unchanged except for the previously empty cell that is now marked. Control then passes to the next player in the predefined turn order. The game enforces implicit constraints such that players cannot mark cells outside the 5x5 board boundaries, and no cell can be occupied by more than one mark at a time. The game terminates if any player achieves a four-in-a-row line—either horizontally across a row, vertically down a column, or diagonally across the board—or when there are no empty cells left to mark. The scoring system assigns 100 points to any player who forms such a four-in-a-row line, 66 points to a player who achieves a contiguous sequence of exactly three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal without a four-in-a-row, 33 points if the player has no such lines but the game board is still active without others having formed lines, and 0 points if another player has formed a line while the player has not. The game thus emphasizes strategic placement to create longer sequences of marks, and the turn control and noop mechanism ensure orderly progression of moves among all three players.
