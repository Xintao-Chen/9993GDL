The game is played on an 8-by-8 grid where the columns are labeled from 'a' to 'h' and the rows from 1 to 8, establishing a coordinate system that identifies each cell uniquely by a letter-number pair. There are two players, White and Black, who alternate turns, with White beginning the game in control. The initial state places mostly empty cells denoted by 'b', except for certain cells containing white pawns ('wp') and black pawns ('bp') positioned in specific rows and columns: white pawns occupy cells c2 and e2, while black pawns are at d7 and f7. On each turn, the player in control performs exactly one move action, which involves moving a pawn of their color from one cell (identified by coordinates u and v) to another cell (identified by coordinates x and y). This action is legal only if it involves moving a pawn currently occupying the source cell, and it does not attempt to move onto the opponent's back row unless the pawn is of the opposing color. The move updates the state by clearing the pawn from the original cell and placing it onto the target cell, provided that the target cell is within the board boundaries and unoccupied. Notably, if a white pawn reaches row 8 or a black pawn reaches row 1, it does not remain as a pawn in the subsequent state, reflecting a constraint that prevents pawns from existing on the opponent's back rank. Turn control alternates automatically after each move, and the game continues until a terminal condition is met, though such conditions are not explicitly defined in the given rules. There is no explicit noop action described, so players must make a legal move each turn. Victory criteria or scoring is not specified within the provided information.
