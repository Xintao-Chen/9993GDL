This game takes place on a 10 by 10 grid, with coordinates defined by indices from 1 to 10 along both the x and y axes. Two players, designated as white and black, participate and alternate turns in a fixed sequence starting with white. Initially, each player has four pieces placed on the board: white occupies the cells at positions (1,4), (4,1), (7,1), and (10,4), while black occupies (1,7), (4,10), (7,10), and (10,7). The game proceeds in alternating phases where a player first makes a move action followed by a fire action before yielding control to their opponent; thus, a full turn for a player consists of a move phase and then a fire phase. On their move phase, a player may either move one of their pieces along an unblocked straight path in any of the eight compass directions (north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest) to an unoccupied cell, or choose to take no action if it is not their turn. The movement must be along a continuous open path without passing over occupied cells, and only one piece may occupy a cell at any time. After moving, in the fire phase, the player must select a target cell along a clear line of sight from the piece's new position, again moving in any of the eight compass directions without obstruction, to fire an arrow that occupies that cell and permanently blocks it for the remainder of the game. The firing action is only legal if it follows the player's move and targets an unoccupied, reachable cell along an open path. If it is not a playerâ€™s turn to move or fire, they may issue a noop (no operation) action. The game state updates accordingly: pieces move to new positions, cells vacated by moved pieces become empty, and fired arrows mark cells as permanently occupied and unusable. The game ends when the current player has no legal move actions available on their move phase, indicating no possible moves for any of their pieces. Victory is determined by the player who made the last successful move and fire sequence before the opponent loses all legal moves; the player to move last receives a score of 100, while the opponent receives 0. Implicit constraints include that no piece or arrow may occupy the same cell, moves and fires must remain within the board boundaries, and movement and firing paths must be strictly linear along defined compass directions without jumping over occupied squares.
