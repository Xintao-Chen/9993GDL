The game is set on an 8-by-8 grid coordinate system with cells labeled from 1 to 8 on both the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) axes, where each cell is identified by its x and y coordinates. Two player roles exist: the explorer and the ghost, who alternate turns with the explorer starting first. Initially, the explorer is positioned at cell (2,6) and the ghost at cell (7,3), with an exit located at cell (8,8). Certain cells have directional blockages either to their north or east, preventing movement through those edges. On each turn, the player in control may choose a move action specifying a direction—north, south, east, west, or nowhere—or, in the case of the ghost, may also choose to drop slime. Legal moves for the explorer require that the target adjacent cell be within the board boundaries, not blocked by north or east walls, and not the 'nowhere' direction unless it is not their turn, in which case doing nothing (move nowhere) is permitted. Similarly, the ghost can move to any adjacent cell within the board or choose to drop slime at its current location; dropping slime leaves a slime marker on the cell occupied by the ghost. After each action, control passes to the other player, and the game step counter increments by one. The explorer and ghost cannot move through blocked edges, and movement must remain within the board cells. The game terminates under three conditions: if the explorer reaches the exit cell, if the explorer occupies a cell with slime (melting), or if 50 steps have elapsed (timeout). Scoring favors the explorer when successfully reaching the exit, earning a score of 100; if the explorer melts or fails to exit within 50 steps, the explorer's score is zero or 50 respectively. Conversely, the ghost scores 100 points if the explorer melts, 50 points if the game times out without exit or melting, and zero if the explorer successfully reaches the exit. Overall, the game revolves around the explorer attempting to reach the exit safely while avoiding slime dropped by the ghost, both constrained by board boundaries and directional blockages, with alternating turns and clear conditions for legal actions and game termination.
