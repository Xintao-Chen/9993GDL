This game is played on an 8-by-8 grid labeled with columns a through h and rows 1 through 8, forming a coordinate system where each cell is identified by a letter-number pair such as a1 or h8. There is a single player role named "player" who takes turns making moves. The initial state places a single knight piece on cell a1, while all other cells are initially blank. The game progresses in discrete steps starting from 1 and incrementing by one each turn. On each turn, the player must either move the knight or if no legal moves exist, the game ends. A move action consists of the player specifying a target cell to which the knight will move. Moves are legal only if the knight currently occupies some cell and the target cell is blank, and the move corresponds to a valid knight's move in chess: specifically, the knight moves in an "L" shape by moving two columns in one direction and one row perpendicular to that, or vice versa. The adjacency of rows and the sequence of columns are defined to enforce these constraints. When the player moves the knight to a new cell, that cell becomes occupied by the knight, and the previous cell becomes occupied by an "o" marker, representing a trail or visited cell. All other cells retain their current state unless changed by the move. The step counter advances by one after each move. The game implicitly disallows moves outside the 8-by-8 board and prohibits moving onto any cell already occupied by "o" or the knight itself. The game terminates when the player has no legal knight moves available. The scoring depends on how many steps have been taken: reaching step 64 yields a score of 100, and the score decreases in increments of 10 for ranges of steps below 64, going down to 0 if fewer than 32 steps have been completed. Thus, the objective is to move the knight around the board as long as possible without running out of legal moves, maximizing the number of steps taken before termination.
