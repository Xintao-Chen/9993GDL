The game takes place on a 6-by-6 grid with coordinates labeled from 1 to 6 along both the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) axes. There are two players, named white and black, who alternate turns starting with white. Initially, white occupies all cells in the first and second rows, while black occupies all cells in the fifth and sixth rows, with control set to white to begin the game. On a player's turn, they may either move one of their pieces or perform a noop action, which is only allowed when it is not their turn, effectively passing control. Moves consist of relocating a piece from one cell to another adjacent cell that is one step forward in the y-direction (toward the opponent's side), either directly forward or diagonally one cell to the left or right. For white, this means moving from row y to y+1; for black, moving from y to y-1. Moves are only legal if the destination cell is within the board boundaries, unoccupied by the player's own pieces (captures are not explicitly defined, so moving onto an opponent's piece is disallowed), and must not result in overlapping pieces. After a move, the piece's position updates to the new cell, and the previous cell becomes empty. Control then switches to the opposing player. The game ends when either a white piece reaches the sixth row or a black piece reaches the first row, or if a player loses all their pieces. Upon termination, the player who fulfilled these winning conditions is declared the winner, earning a score of 100, while the loser scores 0. If the game is ongoing, both players have a score of 100. This setup enforces boundaries on movement, prohibits overlapping or moving backward, and ensures strict alternation of turns with the possibility of noop moves when out of turn.
