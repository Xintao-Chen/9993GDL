This game is played on a three-dimensional cubic lattice with coordinates ranging from 0 to 7 along each of the x, y, and z axes, forming an 8x8x8 grid. The environment consists of cubes initially placed at ground level (z = 0) in a triangular formation where each layer extends one unit further along the x and y axes, starting from (0,0,0) up to (7,7,0). Three players participate, each assigned the roles yellow, red, and green, who take turns in a fixed cyclical order: yellow moves first, followed by red, then green, and back to yellow. At the start, the player yellow has control, and each player possesses 28 cubes to place within the grid. On a player's turn, they may perform either a "put" action, specifying coordinates (x, y, z) where they wish to place one of their cubes, or a "noop" action, which passes their turn without placing a cube but is only permitted when it is not their turn to move.

A "put" action is legal if the player has control and the targeted cube position is open for placement according to two conditions: either the cube lies directly above a fully formed cubic structure comprised of that player's previously placed cubes—meaning that the positions immediately below it along the x, y, and z axes are all occupied by cubes of the same player—or if no other player currently has any open cubic positions at that coordinate, allowing placement at the ground level or other valid positions. The game enforces that players can only place cubes atop existing cubes that form a complete cube underneath, ensuring stable stacking in the three-dimensional space. Occupancy conflicts are prevented by disallowing placement on already filled positions, and coordinates must remain within the board boundaries from 0 to 7 in each dimension.

When a player places a cube, their cube count decreases by one, and the game's state updates to reflect the newly filled cube position with that player's color. Control typically passes to the next player with remaining cubes unless certain conditions prevent this, such as when the current player has no cubes left or other players have open cubic positions, in which case control remains unchanged. The "noop" action acts as a mechanism for players to skip their move when it is not their turn, ensuring orderly turn progression.

The game terminates when the last possible cube position at coordinates (7,7,7) becomes filled, marking the completion of the cubic lattice. Scoring is based on ownership of the cube at this terminal position: if a player occupies the last cube and no other players have open cubic positions at that location, they receive a full score of 100 points; if other players have open cubic positions at that coordinate, the occupying player scores 50 points; all other players receive zero points at the game's end. Thus, victory is determined by the strategic placement of cubes to control the topmost position of the cubic structure while preventing opponents from maintaining open positions above it.
