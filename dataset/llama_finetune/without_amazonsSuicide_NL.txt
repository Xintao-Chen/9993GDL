The game is played on a 10-by-10 grid with coordinates ranging from 1 to 10 along both the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) axes, where each cell is identified by an (x, y) pair. There are two players, White and Black, who alternate turns, with White starting the game in control. At the start, White has four pieces placed at coordinates (4,1), (7,1), (1,4), and (10,4), while Black’s four pieces are initially positioned at (1,7), (10,7), (4,10), and (7,10). On a player’s turn, if they have control, they may either perform a move action or choose to do nothing (noop) if it is not their turn; noop actions are only legal for players not currently in control. A legal move action consists of selecting one of the player’s own pieces at a starting cell (x1, y1), moving that piece along a queen-like trajectory (combining rook and bishop moves) to an unoccupied cell (x2, y2), and optionally shooting an arrow from the piece’s new position to a third distinct unoccupied cell (x3, y3); alternatively, the arrow shot may be omitted by specifying the arrow’s target as the same cell as the moved piece’s original location, effectively not placing an arrow. Movement and arrow shooting must follow queen moves that do not pass through any occupied cells, with the arrow’s path checked ignoring the piece’s original cell but not ignoring any other obstacles. The queen moves encompass horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions, each advancing step-by-step through empty cells within the board boundaries. Cells are considered empty if they contain no white piece, no black piece, and no arrow. After executing a move, the piece relocates to the destination cell (x2, y2), an arrow marker is placed at the arrow target cell (x3, y3), and the original cell (x1, y1) becomes empty. Control then passes to the opposing player. The game forbids placing pieces or arrows outside the 1-to-10 coordinate range or onto occupied cells. The game terminates when the player whose turn it is has no legal moves available; at this point, that player loses and receives a score of zero, while the opponent scores 100, establishing the victory condition as rendering the opponent unable to move. The scoring reflects a binary outcome where making a move is neutral (goal 0) and being unable to move yields defeat (goal 0) for that player and victory (goal 100) for the other. Thus, players alternate moving their pieces in queen-like fashion, optionally firing an arrow shot that blocks cells, and the game continues until one player is immobilized, determining the winner.
