The game is played on an 8-by-8 grid defined by files labeled from 'a' to 'h' for columns and ranks numbered from 1 to 8 for rows, forming a coordinate system where each cell is identified by a file and rank pair. There are two players, Black and White, who alternate turns starting with Black having control initially. The initial state places Black's pieces along the second and seventh ranks from files b through g, and White's pieces along the a and h files from ranks 2 to 7, respectively. On a player's turn, they may either perform a move or pass by issuing a noop action if they have no legal moves; a player not in control may only perform noop actions. A legal move consists of selecting one of the player's pieces on the board and moving it in a straight line along one of the eight compass directions (north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest) for a distance equal to the length of a contiguous line of pieces aligned in that direction including the starting piece. Movement is legal if the destination cell is either empty or occupied by an opponent's piece; pieces cannot jump over opponent pieces or empty spaces except as allowed by contiguous lines of the player's own pieces. Pieces move by sliding in the chosen direction, and the affected cells are updated accordingly, with the piece vacating its original cell and occupying the target cell. Turns alternate control between players with each move or noop, and each turn increments a step counter. Implicit constraints include board boundaries which confine movement within files a to h and ranks 1 to 8, and adjacency defined by cells next to each other in any of the eight directions. The game ends when either player has all their pieces connected in a single cluster, meaning every piece is reachable from every other piece through adjacent pieces of the same player, or when 50 steps have elapsed. The victory condition awards 100 points to a player who achieves full connectivity of their pieces while the opponent does not; if both players have fully connected pieces or neither does by the end, the score is a draw of 50 points for each player. Thus, the objective is to maneuver pieces to form a single connected group while preventing the opponent from doing the same, within the turn limit.
