The game is played on an 8-by-8 grid where cells are numbered from 1 to 8 along both the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) axes, with coordinates increasing upwards and to the right. There are two players, Bomberman and Bomberwoman, who alternate turns, each able to perform one action per turn. Initially, Bomberman starts at position (1,1) and Bomberwoman at position (8,8). Certain edges between cells are blocked either to the north or east, preventing movement or effects across those boundaries, and these blockades are fixed throughout the game. On each turn, a player may choose to move one step in one of the four cardinal directions—north, south, east, or west—provided the destination cell exists within the grid, is not blocked by a barrier, and is reachable by a legal step, or alternatively choose to drop a bomb at their current location. Movement actions are legal only if the step is within boundaries and not obstructed; dropping a bomb is always a legal action. After an action is taken, player locations update accordingly: moving changes the player's position to the adjacent cell in the chosen direction, while dropping a bomb leaves the player in place but places a new bomb at their current coordinates. Bombs progress through four states labeled bomb3, bomb2, bomb1, and bomb0 in successive turns, representing the countdown to explosion. When a bomb reaches the bomb0 state, it triggers a fire event that affects the bomb's own cell and extends to adjacent cells to the north and east, unless blocked by the fixed barriers. If either Bomberman or Bomberwoman occupies a cell with fire, that player is considered burned and loses. The game also automatically increments a step counter each turn, and the game ends either if a player is burned or if 50 steps have elapsed, constituting a timeout. Scoring is based on the state at termination: a player who is not burned but whose opponent is burned wins with a score of 100, a burned player receives 0, and if both are burned or the game times out without any player burned, both receive 50 points. Players may also choose a "nowhere" move that results in no positional change, effectively serving as a noop action. The game terminates immediately upon a player being burned or when the timeout step limit is reached. Thus, the strategic interplay revolves around navigating the grid, avoiding barriers and fire, and tactically dropping bombs to eliminate the opponent before the step limit is reached.
