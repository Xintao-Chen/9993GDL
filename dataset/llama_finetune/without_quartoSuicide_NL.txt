The game takes place on a four-by-four grid with coordinates ranging from 1 to 4 along both the x (columns) and y (rows) axes, where each cell can either be empty or contain a unique piece identified by a four-bit binary code. There are two players, white and black, who alternate turns in a fixed sequence: white first has the control to select a piece from a common pool of available pieces, then white places the selected piece onto an empty cell of the board; control then passes to black, who similarly selects a piece and places it, and so on, switching between selection and placement phases within each player’s turn cycle. The initial state of the game features all sixteen cells empty and all sixteen distinct pieces available in the pool, with white starting by selecting a piece. On a player’s turn, if it is their selection phase, they must choose a piece that remains in the pool; if it is their placement phase, they must place the previously selected piece onto a currently empty cell. No action is allowed outside of these phases, and when a player is not in either selection or placement control, they may only perform a no-operation (noop). Selecting a piece removes it from the pool and marks it as currently selected, while placing a piece updates the targeted cell to contain that piece and frees the selection for the next player; all other cells remain unchanged. The game enforces board boundaries strictly—only cells within the 1-to-4 range on both axes are valid—and prohibits placing a piece onto an occupied cell. Cells are considered distinct if either their x or y coordinates differ. The game ends when either a "line" is formed or no empty cells remain on the board. A "line" is defined as a row, column, or diagonal in which all four cells contain pieces sharing the same bit value at a certain bit position across their binary codes, effectively creating a uniform bit pattern along that line. Victory conditions depend on whether a line has been formed and which player placed the last piece: if a line exists and the player who did not place last gets 100 points, while the last player scores zero; if no line exists and the board is full (no empty cells), both players receive 50 points; if no line exists and the board still has empty cells, both players score zero. Thus, the game’s objective is to avoid creating a uniform bit-patterned line with your last move, as that yields zero points for the last player and a perfect score for the opponent, incentivizing strategic selection and placement of pieces to control the board state and prevent the opponent’s victory.
