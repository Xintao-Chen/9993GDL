The game is structured as a turn-based guessing game involving two players, identified as player1 and player2, who alternate turns in a fixed order beginning with player1. The environment consists of a numeric range from 0 to 100 inclusive, which serves as the valid domain for guesses; this range is implicitly defined by successor relationships establishing the integers and by the predicate that specifies guessable numbers as those less than or equal to 100. At the start of the game, no guesses have been made by either player. On each turn, the active player must choose a legal action by guessing a number within the allowable range. The action format consists of the player role followed by the guess action with the chosen number, such as "guess n," where n is any number between 0 and 100 inclusive. This action is legal only if the number guessed falls within the permitted range and the role corresponds to a player in the game. When a player makes a guess, the game state updates to record that player's guessed number. The game does not explicitly provide a no-operation or noop action, implying that skipping a turn is not allowed; players must guess on their turn. The game terminates immediately after both players have made their guesses. At termination, the game calculates the sum of the two guesses and then determines two-thirds of this total, with some tolerance for rounding up or down by one unit. Each player's closeness score is computed as the absolute difference between their guessed number and this two-thirds average value. The player whose guess is closest to the two-thirds average is deemed the winner and receives a goal score of 100, while the other player receives a score of zero. In the event both players are equally closest, both receive a score of 50. Implicit constraints include the board boundaries that restrict guesses to the integers between 0 and 100 inclusive, and the requirement that each player makes exactly one guess. The primary victory condition is to be the player whose guess is closest to two-thirds of the sum of both guesses, with scoring accordingly assigned to reflect this outcome.
