The game unfolds on a grid-based board environment consisting of two separate boards labeled 1 and 2, each with columns numbered from 1 to 8 along the horizontal axis and rows numbered from 1 to 6 along the vertical axis, forming an 8-by-6 coordinate system where the x-coordinate ranges from 1 to 8 and the y-coordinate ranges from 1 to 6. Two players participate in the game, designated as red and black, who alternate turns with red moving first on board 1 and black following on board 2. The initial state grants control to the red player on board 1 and to the black player on board 2, establishing the turn order and starting positions. During each turn, a player may perform exactly one action, which consists of dropping a piece into one of the columns of the current board under their control, specified by the command "drop" followed by the target column number and the board number. An action is legal only if it is the acting player’s turn on the specified board and the selected column is open, meaning that its topmost cell (row 6) is empty and can accept a new piece. Pieces fall to the lowest available position within the chosen column; if the column is empty, the piece occupies the bottom cell (row 1), otherwise it occupies the nearest open cell above the highest occupied cell in that column. After a piece is placed, the cell state updates to reflect the presence of the player's piece, and control switches to the opposing player on the same board, ensuring strict alternation of turns. Players have no explicit "noop" action; they must drop a piece into an open column during their turn. The game has implicit constraints such as the board boundaries limiting legal coordinates to columns 1 through 8 and rows 1 through 6, and occupancy conflicts preventing placing a piece in a cell already occupied by either player. The game terminates when either player forms a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four consecutive pieces on their board—this line is detected by checking sequences of four adjacent cells where all are occupied by the same player—or when no columns remain open on either board, indicating the board is full. Scoring is determined at termination: a player who achieves a four-in-a-row line alone is awarded a perfect score of 100 points, while if both players achieve lines simultaneously, both receive a score of 50 points. If the game ends with no lines formed and the board is full, both players receive 50 points; if one player has formed a line and the other has not, the line-forming player gets 100 points and the other 0. Conversely, if the game terminates with no lines and still open columns, both players receive zero points. The objective is to create a line of four of one's own pieces on the player's designated board before the opponent does or before the board fills up, with victory awarded accordingly based on the final scoring.
