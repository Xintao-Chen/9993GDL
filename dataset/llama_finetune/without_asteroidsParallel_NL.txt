This game is set in a two-dimensional coordinate system where positions are defined by x and y coordinates, and directions are indicated by headings that can be north, east, south, or west. The environment features two players, each controlling a ship with roles identified as ship. Both players take turns simultaneously, as there is only one role, ship, that performs actions per step. The initial state sets both ships at position (10,10) facing north, with northward and eastward speeds of 3 and 2 respectively, and the game step counter initialized to 1. On each turn, the player controlling the ship chooses one action from a set that includes nine possible combined maneuvers labeled thrustThrust, thrustClock, thrustCounter, clockThrust, clockClock, clockCounter, counterThrust, counterClock, and counterCounter, each representing a combination of thrusting or turning clockwise or counterclockwise. The actions are formatted as do followed by one of these move commands, and legality depends on being one of these predefined moves available to the ship role. When an action is executed, the ship’s heading updates according to whether the move involves thrusting (which maintains heading), turning clockwise, or turning counterclockwise, with heading changes following a fixed cyclic order: north to east to south to west and back to north for clockwise turns, and the reverse for counterclockwise. Speed components north-speed and east-speed are adjusted depending on the heading and the move chosen; thrust moves increase or decrease speed in the direction of the heading, while turning moves keep the speeds unchanged. The ship’s position updates by adding the current east-speed to the x-coordinate and the north-speed to the y-coordinate using a modular addition system that wraps values in a defined range from 1 to 20. The game step counter increments automatically each turn. There is no explicit noop action, but since only specified moves are legal, a player must choose one of the nine moves each turn. Implicit constraints include the map boundaries defined by the modular arithmetic on coordinates, meaning positions wrap around when exceeding bounds; this ensures continuous movement on a toroidal grid. The ships’ speeds range between -3 and 3 northward and eastward, with predefined increment and decrement steps. The game terminates when either ship comes to a complete stop (both north-speed and east-speed zero), or when 50 steps have elapsed, indicated by the step counter reaching 50. Victory and scoring depend on whether ships have stopped and their location relative to a planet at (15,5). A ship that has stopped exactly at the planet’s coordinates earns the maximum score of 100, while stopping elsewhere yields 50 points; if a ship has not stopped, it scores zero. The final score for the single ship player is a function of the two ships’ goals, combining their respective scores in a predefined manner that yields values of 0, 25, 50, 75, or 100 based on the combination of individual ship scores. In summary, the game challenges players to maneuver their ships through thrust and turning actions on a bounded but wrapping coordinate grid, managing speeds and headings to bring their ship to rest at a designated planetary location within a limited number of steps to maximize their score.
