This game is played on an 8-by-8 grid with coordinates ranging from 1 to 8 along both the x- and y-axes, where each cell is identified by an (x, y) pair. The board's squares are distinguished by parity: squares where both coordinates are odd or both even are considered even squares, which are the locations where pieces are placed and moved. There are two players, Black and Red, who take alternating turns starting with Black. The initial setup places twelve black pawns on the bottom three rows in a staggered pattern on even squares and twelve red pawns on the top three rows in a similar arrangement. Each pawn is owned by its respective player. The control alternates between Black and Red each turn, with a step count incrementing from 1 upwards each turn. On a player's turn, if they have a legal jump available, they must perform a jump; if no jump is available, they may make a valid move. If the player is not in control, their only legal action is to do nothing (noop). A move action consists of moving one of the player's pawns diagonally forward by one square to an empty square; Black pawns move diagonally upwards (increasing both x and y by 1 or decreasing x by 1 while increasing y by 1), and Red pawns move diagonally downwards (increasing or decreasing x by 1 while decreasing y by 1). A jump action involves leaping over an opponent's pawn diagonally forward by two squares, landing on an empty square immediately beyond the jumped pawn, which must be directly between the start and end squares. Black pawns jump over Red pawns diagonally forward, and Red pawns jump over Black pawns similarly but moving in the opposite vertical direction. After a jump, the player's capture count increases by one. The game enforces that a player cannot move or jump onto occupied squares, and all moves must remain within the bounds of the 8-by-8 board. The state updates each turn by moving the chosen pawn to its new location, removing any captured pieces from the board, updating the capture counts, switching control to the opponent, and incrementing the step counter. The game ends (reaches a terminal state) if either player loses all their pawns, or if the player in control has no legal moves or jumps available, or if the step count reaches 100. Scoring is based on the number of pawns captured by each player, with a predefined score mapping that assigns increasing point values to higher capture counts, culminating in a maximum score of 100 for capturing all twelve opponent pawns. The winner is determined by the player with the higher capture count at the end of the game.
