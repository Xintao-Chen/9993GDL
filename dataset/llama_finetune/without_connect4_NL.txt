The game is played on a grid defined by coordinates where columns range from 1 to 7 and rows range from 0 to 6, with an initial setup consisting of the bottom row (row 0) filled with dirt cells and the cells above (rows 1 through 6) initially containing blank spaces. There are two players, white and red, who alternate turns starting with white having the control at the beginning. On a player’s turn, they may perform an action called "drop" by selecting a column number between 1 and 7. The drop action places the player’s piece into the lowest available blank cell in that column, immediately above the highest filled cell, causing the piece to occupy that position. If it is not a player's turn, that player may only perform the noop action, which does nothing and simply passes the turn back to the opponent. Moves are legal only if the chosen column contains at least one blank cell above a filled cell, ensuring pieces stack from the bottom up, and the control alternates after each move. The game enforces implicit constraints including the board boundaries (columns 1 to 7 and rows 0 to 6), occupancy where each cell can only hold one piece or dirt, and the vertical stacking rule where pieces must occupy the lowest available position in their column. The game proceeds until a terminal condition is met, which occurs when either player forms a consecutive line of four pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when the board has no blank cells left (no open moves). Victory is awarded to the player who first achieves a four-in-a-row line, scoring 100 points, while the opponent scores zero. If the board fills without any player achieving such a line, both players score 50 points. If the game is still ongoing with open moves and no winner yet, both players have a provisional score of 70 points. This setup and ruleset correspond to a classic connect-four style game where players alternate dropping pieces into columns aiming to line up four consecutively.
