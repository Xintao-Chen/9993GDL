The game is played on a board defined by a coordinate system where cells are identified by a pair consisting of a letter from A to G and a number, with each letter corresponding to a row length varying from 4 to 7 cells; valid cells are those within these defined lengths and the coordinates follow adjacency relationships that include horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections as specified by the connected predicate. There are two players, player1 and player2, assigned colors red and blue respectively at the start, with red controlling the first move. The initial state sets red as the controlling color and flags the first turn as special, called the pie turn. Players alternate turns, with control passing between red and blue according to whether certain adjacency conditions are met after a move; specifically, if a move results in two or more adjacent opposing pieces, control remains with the same player, otherwise control switches to the opponent. On the first turn only, player2 has a special choice to swap colors with player1 or not, a mechanism known as the pie rule designed to balance the game; if player2 chooses to swap, colors are exchanged, otherwise colors remain the same. Actions are either a move, which places a piece of the player's color on an empty valid cell, the swap or doNotSwap action available only to player2 at the pie turn, or a noop action, which is permitted only when the player does not currently control the turn. Moves must be legal in that the targeted cell is empty and it is the player's turn to control their color, with the exception that no moves are allowed during the pie turn phase. Upon a move, the board state updates to mark the cell as occupied by the player's color and increments that player's piece count; the move can also trigger evaluation of adjacent opposing pieces to determine control for the next turn. The game enforces implicit constraints such as occupancy conflicts where a cell cannot be occupied by more than one piece, and boundaries defined by the valid cells on the board. Noops serve to pass the turn when a player is not in control, ensuring proper turn sequencing. The game terminates when a player places their nineteenth piece on the board, immediately winning the game. Victory is awarded fully to the player who achieves this piece count first, while the opponent scores zero. The scoring system thus hinges solely on the piece count reaching nineteen for a player, with no other scoring conditions. In summary, this game involves strategic placement of pieces on a hexagonal-like grid, alternating turns with a pie rule on the first move to balance initial advantage, and ends when one player successfully places nineteen pieces, signifying their win.
