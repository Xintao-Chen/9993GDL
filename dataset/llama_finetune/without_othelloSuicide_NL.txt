The game is played on an 8-by-8 grid with coordinates ranging from 1 to 8 along both the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) axes. There are two players, Black and Red, who alternate turns with Black having the initial control. The initial setup places four pieces in the center of the board: Black pieces at positions (4,4) and (5,5), and Red pieces at (4,5) and (5,4). On a player's turn, they may either place a piece of their color on an empty cell or perform a no-operation (noop) if no legal moves are available; a player may also noop if it is not their turn. A move consists of specifying the coordinates (x,y) where the player wishes to mark a piece. A move is legal only if it is the player's turn, the target cell is empty, and placing a piece there would flip at least one of the opponent’s pieces by bracketing them in a straight line—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—between the newly placed piece and another piece of the player's color. If no such legal moves exist, the player must choose noop. When a piece is placed, all opponent's pieces that are flanked in any direction by the player's new piece and another piece of the player’s color are flipped to the player's color. If the opponent chooses noop while the player retains control over a cell, that cell remains unchanged. The game's state updates accordingly each turn, switching control between Black and Red. The board boundaries restrict placement to cells within the 8x8 grid. Occupied cells cannot be chosen for placement, and moves must adhere to the flipping rules to be legal. The game ends when neither player has any legal moves remaining. Scoring is determined by counting the number of pieces each player has on the board at termination. The player with the higher count wins and receives a score of 100, the loser receives 0, and in case of a tie, both players score 50. If the game is not over, both players have a score of 0. Thus, the game proceeds via alternating moves or noops, with piece placement that flips opponent pieces according to adjacency rules within the bounded 8x8 board, concluding when no further moves are possible and scoring based on piece majority.
