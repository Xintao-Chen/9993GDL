The game is played on a grid defined by rows labeled from 'a' through 'i' and columns numbered from 1 through 9, with certain positions marked as out of bounds to create an irregular board shape. The board includes three types of lines: horizontal rows, vertical columns, and special diagonal-like vertical lines identified by labels such as 'a5', 'a6', up to 'e9', each encompassing specific cells on the board. Two players, red and blue, alternate turns starting with red having the initial control. On a player's turn, they may either place their marker on a cell or perform a noop (no operation) move if it is not their turn. A placement action consists of specifying the row and column coordinates, and is legal only if the chosen cell is within bounds and unoccupied by either player's marker. After a placement, the cell becomes occupied by the placing player's marker, and the control switches to the other player. The game maintains counts of markers placed by each player along various lines. When a player places a marker on a cell that belongs to a particular line, the count for that line and player increments by one. In addition to line counts, the game tracks the number of lines in which a player is one marker short of achieving a majority, where majority thresholds vary per line and are predefined by the game's parameters. A playerâ€™s goal is to secure a majority in at least five lines in any two of the three categories: letter lines (rows), number lines (columns), or vertical lines (the special diagonals). The game reaches a terminal state when a player achieves this condition, winning with a score of 100, while the opponent scores zero. Throughout the game, moves must respect the board boundaries and avoid placing markers in occupied or out-of-bounds cells. The sequence of play continues with players alternating turns, placing markers or passing when it is not their turn, until one player fulfills the victory criteria by attaining majorities in the requisite lines.
