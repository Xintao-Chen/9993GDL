The game takes place on a grid defined by rows labeled from 'a' through 'g' and columns labeled from 'c1' through 'c7', forming a coordinate system where each hole is identified by a row and column pair. There is a single player role called "jumper," who takes turns making moves throughout the game. The initial configuration places pegs in almost every hole except for the central hole at row 'd' and column 'c4', which starts empty. On each turn, the jumper may perform a jump action, specified by the starting hole coordinates (source row and column) and the destination hole coordinates (destination row and column). This action is legal only if the starting hole contains a peg, the destination hole is empty, and there exists a middle hole directly between the start and destination positions that also contains a peg. The middle hole is determined by either being horizontally or vertically adjacent between the start and destination holes, with adjacency defined by successor and predecessor relations for rows and columns. When a jump occurs, the peg from the starting hole moves to the destination hole, the peg in the middle hole is removed (the hole becomes empty), and the original starting hole becomes empty. All other holes retain their states unless affected by the jump. Moves cannot be made outside the defined board boundaries, and holes cannot be occupied by more than one peg. The game continues as long as there exist valid jump moves; if no move is possible, the game ends. Scoring is based on the number of remaining pegs, tracked by a counter starting at 32 and decreasing by one after each jump. The highest score of 100 is awarded if the final remaining peg is at the central hole (row 'd', column 'c4') with only one peg left on the board. Scores decrease progressively as more pegs remain or if the last peg is not in the central hole. If no pegs remain or the number of pegs does not meet these criteria, the score can be as low as zero. There is no explicit noop action defined; the game progresses by the jumper making legal jumps until no such moves are available, at which point the game terminates automatically.
