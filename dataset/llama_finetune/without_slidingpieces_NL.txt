This game takes place on a grid-based board defined by coordinates with columns labeled from x1 to x4 and rows labeled from y1 to y5, establishing a coordinate system where each cell is identified by a unique (y, x) pair. The directions north, east, south, and west are used to navigate between adjacent cells, with adjacency relationships defined such that moving north or south changes the y-coordinate by one step, while moving east or west changes the x-coordinate by one step, respecting the boundaries of the board. Initially, various pieces labeled piece1 through piece10 and blank spaces are placed on specific cells throughout the grid according to the setup, with some cells intentionally left blank. The game is played by a single player whose turn consists of making moves, and turns progress sequentially through steps numbered from s0 to s81, with each step representing a discrete turn; the player can also perform a no-operation (noop) if no legal moves are available or desired. On a given turn, the player may issue a move action specifying a piece and a direction; a move is legal only if the piece currently occupies a cell and the adjacent cell in the specified direction exists on the board and is not occupied by a different piece, ensuring no overlapping or moving outside the board boundaries. Attempting to move a piece into a blocked cell—one occupied by another distinct piece or outside the board—is illegal. When a legal move is performed, the piece moves from its current cell to the adjacent cell in the chosen direction, vacating its original cell which becomes blank; cells not involved in the move remain unchanged. The game automatically updates the board state after each move, advancing the step counter and reflecting the new piece positions. The game terminates either when the step counter reaches s81 or when a goal condition is met, which requires that four specific cells—namely those at coordinates (y4, x2), (y4, x3), (y5, x2), and (y5, x3)—are all occupied by the piece labeled piece2. Achieving this configuration results in the player receiving a score of 100, indicating victory, while failure to reach this state by step s81 results in a score of 0. Thus, the player's objective is to maneuver the pieces through legal moves within the confines of the board and adjacency rules to align piece2 in the designated goal positions before the maximum number of steps is reached, at which point the game concludes with success or failure accordingly.
