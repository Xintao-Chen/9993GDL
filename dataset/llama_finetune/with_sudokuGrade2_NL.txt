The game is played in an environment consisting of a three-dimensional grid structured as a 3x3x3 cube of smaller 3x3 cells, effectively forming a 3x3 arrangement of 3x3 Sudoku-like boards. The coordinate system uses four indices: the first two indices (i and j) identify which of the nine 3x3 sub-boards (or "squares") within the larger cube is referenced, with values ranging from 1 to 3; the next two indices (k and l) specify the position within each 3x3 sub-board, also each ranging from 1 to 3. There is a single player role named "robot" who takes all turns sequentially throughout the game. The initial state is a partially filled set of cells across the 3x3x3 cube, where each cell may contain a digit from 1 to 9 or be blank (represented as 'b'). The player makes moves by marking a blank cell with a digit from 1 to 9, abiding by the constraint that the chosen digit cannot already exist in the same row, column, or 3x3 sub-board of the cell being marked. More specifically, the "row" constraint applies to all cells sharing the same k and l indices across all i and j coordinates, the "column" constraint applies to all cells sharing the same i and j coordinates but varying k and l, and the "square" constraint applies to the 3x3 sub-board indexed by i and j with fixed k indices. An action is legal only if the targeted cell is currently blank and the digit placed does not violate these Sudoku-like uniqueness rules within its corresponding row, column, or sub-board. On each turn, the robot selects one such legal action to mark a cell. If no legal moves are available, the game terminates. The state updates by replacing the blank cell at the specified coordinates with the chosen digit, while all other cells remain unchanged. The game ends when no empty cells remain or no legal moves can be made, indicated by the absence of any playable moves. The robot's goal is to correctly fill all blank cells without violating the Sudoku constraints, achieving a perfect completion of the puzzle; successful completion awards a goal value of 100, whereas failure to do so results in a goal value of 0. There is no explicit noop action mentioned; the game implicitly ends if no legal marking moves are available. The board boundaries are strictly enforced to the 1-to-3 range for all indices, and occupancy conflicts prevent placing digits in already occupied cells. The victory condition is thus the full and valid completion of the Sudoku-like cube, with scoring based solely on whether the puzzle is completely and correctly solved.
