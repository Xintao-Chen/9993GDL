The game is played on a 10-by-10 grid indexed from 1 to 10 both horizontally and vertically, establishing a coordinate system where each cell is identified by an (x, y) pair with x and y ranging from 1 to 10. There are two players, designated as white and black, who alternate turns beginning with white. Initially, each player controls four pieces positioned at specific coordinates: white pieces start at (4,1), (7,1), (1,4), and (10,4), and black pieces start at (1,7), (10,7), (4,10), and (7,10). On a player's turn, if they are in control, they may choose to either perform a move action or do nothing if it is not their turn, the only legal action available is a "noop." A move action consists of selecting one of the player's pieces located at (x1, y1), moving it along a queen's move (a combination of rook and bishop moves—horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) to an empty cell (x2, y2), and then optionally shooting an arrow from the piece's new position (x2, y2) along another queen's move to an empty cell (x3, y3). The arrow cannot be shot to the original position of the piece before moving, but shooting the arrow back to the piece’s original cell is not allowed either. Moves must be along valid paths with no occupied cells in between, except for the starting and ending positions as specified, ensuring no pieces or arrows block the movement or shooting paths. The board cells can be empty, occupied by white or black pieces, or occupied by an arrow, and no two pieces or arrows can occupy the same cell simultaneously. After a move, the piece's location is updated to the new cell, and an arrow is placed on the targeted cell, which becomes permanently blocked. Control then passes to the opposing player. The game ends when the player to move has no legal moves available, meaning none of their pieces can move to any empty cell along a queen's move. At that point, the player who still has legal moves is declared the winner with a score of 100, while the other player scores 0. If neither player can move, the game is also terminal. The legal move checks and movement validations ensure that all moves must stay within the board boundaries, respect occupancy constraints, and maintain the piece and arrow positions consistent with the rules, thus creating a strategic contest of mobility and obstruction.
