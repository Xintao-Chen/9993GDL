The game is played on a 10-by-10 grid where both the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) coordinates range from 1 to 10, establishing a coordinate system with cells indexed from 1 through 10 along each axis. Two players, identified as white and black, participate in the game, with white making the first move followed by black, and turns alternating thereafter. Initially, each player controls four pieces placed at specific coordinates: white occupies cells (4,1), (7,1), (1,4), and (10,4), while black's pieces are at (1,7), (10,7), (4,10), and (7,10). In any turn, the player whose control it is may either perform a move action or pass by doing a noop, though a noop is only legal when it is not that player's turn. A move action involves selecting one of the player's pieces from its current location and moving it like a queen in chess—that is, along any number of unoccupied cells horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—to a new empty cell. After moving the piece, the player optionally shoots an arrow from the piece's new position, also along a queen-like path to another empty cell, which then becomes permanently occupied by an arrow, effectively blocking that cell for both players. The action format is either a move alone, specifying the starting and ending coordinates of the piece with the arrow position identical to the piece's start, or a move with an arrow shot, specifying three coordinate pairs: the piece's start, the piece's destination, and the arrow's target cell. Moves are legal only if the piece belongs to the player in control, the destination cell is empty, the movement path is unobstructed, and, if an arrow is shot, its path is also unobstructed ignoring the piece's original position but considering all other obstructions. The game enforces implicit constraints such as board boundaries, ensuring all moves and arrow shots stay within the 1-to-10 range on both axes; no cell may be occupied simultaneously by a piece or an arrow; and movement paths must be clear of any other pieces or arrows except where specifically ignored in arrow path checks. After a player completes a legal move and optional arrow shot, control passes to the opposing player. The game terminates when the player to move has no legal moves available for any of their pieces, which means none of their pieces can move to any empty cell along queen-like paths. The player who retains the ability to move when the other cannot is declared the winner and scores 100 points, while the losing player scores zero. If both players have legal moves, the game continues. Thus, the objective is to maneuver one’s pieces and strategically block cells with arrows to trap the opponent’s pieces, preventing any legal moves, thereby winning the game.
