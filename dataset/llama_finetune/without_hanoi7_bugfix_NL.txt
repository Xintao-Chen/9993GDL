The game takes place in an environment consisting of three pillars named pillar1, pillar2, and pillar3, with seven discs of increasing size labeled disc1 through disc7. The coordinate system is hierarchical, where discs can be stacked on top of each other or on pillars, forming towers. Initially, all seven discs are stacked in decreasing size order on pillar1, with disc7 at the bottom and disc1 at the top, while pillar2 and pillar3 are empty and clear. The single player, referred to as "player," takes turns making moves; the turn progression is tracked by a step counter starting at s0 and incrementing sequentially up to s127, after which the game terminates. On each turn, the player may choose to perform a single legal action or no action (a noop). Legal actions consist of moving a clear (uncovered) disc onto a clear target, which can be a pillar or a larger disc, with the condition that the disc being moved must be smaller than the destination object. The action format is expressed as putting one disc onto another object, and legality requires both the source disc and the destination to be clear and that the source disc is strictly smaller in size than the target. After an action, the game state updates so that the moved disc is now on the new object, the previously occupied position of the moved disc becomes clear, and the destination is no longer clear because it now supports the moved disc. If no disc is moved, the state remains unchanged except for the step counter incrementing. The game enforces implicit constraints such as the stacking order reflecting size hierarchy—no disc may be placed on a smaller disc—and only one disc may occupy a position at a time, preventing overlaps. The game ends either when the step counter reaches s127 or when the player achieves a tower of discs on pillar3. The height of the tower is measured by counting the number of discs stacked in proper order on pillar3, starting from zero. The player's score depends on the tower height achieved on pillar3 at the end of the game: a full tower of all seven discs yields the maximum score of 100, with partial towers scoring progressively less, down to zero if the tower is shorter than four discs. Thus, victory is defined by successfully relocating the entire stack from pillar1 to pillar3 in the proper order within the allotted steps, maximizing the score accordingly.
