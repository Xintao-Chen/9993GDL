The game is played on a grid with coordinates ranging from 1 to 13 along the horizontal axis and 1 to 9 along the vertical axis, establishing a rectangular board environment. There are two players, designated as white and black, who alternate turns sequentially. The initial board state is defined by various cells occupied by different markers: many cells are occupied by neutral or fixed markers denoted as "w" or "o," while the white player controls a single "a" marker initially located at coordinate (2,5), and the black player controls a single "b" marker initially at coordinate (12,5). Each turn, a player may either choose to perform a move action or opt for a no-operation (noop), which is always legal for both players. Moves consist of transferring their respective marker ("a" for white, "b" for black) from its current cell to an orthogonally adjacent cell that contains the neutral marker "o." Moves are only legal if the target cell is adjacent either horizontally or vertically, and if the player's marker is not already occupying a certain restricted coordinate—specifically, the white player may not move if their marker is already at (12,5), and the black player may not move if their marker is at (2,5). Attempting to move onto a cell occupied by the opponent’s marker during the same turn results in a collision, in which case the cell contents remain unchanged. The step counter increments by one after each turn, starting from 1 and progressing up to a maximum of 30, which also serves as a terminal condition. The game can also end when both players have their markers positioned simultaneously at the opponent’s starting coordinates, i.e., white at (12,5) and black at (2,5). Throughout the game, two counters track the steps at which each player reaches their respective opposite corners: white reaching (12,5) and black reaching (2,5). The scoring system is based on these events: if white has reached (12,5) and black has not reached (2,5), white wins with a score of 100 and black scores 0; conversely, if black has reached (2,5) and white has not reached (12,5), black scores 100 and white 0. If both have reached the other's starting positions, the scores depend on who arrived first, with the earlier arrival earning a higher score (75 for the faster player and 25 for the slower), and if both arrive simultaneously, both players score 50. Throughout, the board boundaries and adjacency constraints govern valid moves, and the occupancy of cells prevents overlapping markers except in cases resulting in collision, which does not alter the state. The game terminates either when 30 steps have elapsed or when both players have simultaneously occupied the opponent's starting positions. The player with the higher score according to these conditions is deemed the winner.
