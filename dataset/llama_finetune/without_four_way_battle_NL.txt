The game is played on a two-dimensional grid with coordinates running from 1 to 6 along both axes, defining the board’s boundaries. Four player roles exist: north, south, east, and west, who take turns in that order. The initial state sets the turn counter to zero and places specific pieces on the board: pawns and kings belonging to each player are arranged at designated coordinates near their respective edges. Each player owns a distinct set of pieces marked by role-specific prefixes. On their turn, a player may perform either a move or a defend action. A move consists of specifying a starting coordinate and a target coordinate within one unit of distance horizontally, vertically, or diagonally for kings, while pawns may move only one step horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally. Moves are only legal if the piece belongs to the acting player, the target cell is unoccupied by their own pieces, and the move alters the position. A defend action involves choosing a piece currently on the board that the player owns and electing to defend it, which affects capture logic. If no move or defend action is taken, the player effectively performs a noop implicitly. After an action, the game state updates accordingly: pieces remain in place unless moved; if a move targets a cell occupied by an opponent’s piece that is not defended, and no other player attempts to move to the same cell, the moving player captures that piece, incrementing their capture count. If the attacked piece is defended by its owner, the defender is credited with a capture instead. The turn counter increments by one after each turn. Implicit constraints include the board’s fixed 6x6 dimensions, the limitation of piece movement to adjacent coordinates as specified, and the rule that no two pieces of the same player can occupy the same cell. The game ends either when the step count reaches 40, when any player no longer owns any pieces on the board, or when a player reaches a capture count of 10. Victory is determined by scoring based on the number of opponent pieces captured: each capture increases a player’s payoff by 10 points, with a maximum payoff of 100. The player with the highest payoff or who reaches 100 points first wins, and elimination of a player’s pieces also triggers game termination. Thus, the game emphasizes strategic movement and defending to capture opponent pieces while managing positional constraints on a bounded grid through sequential turns among four distinct players.
