The game is played on a rectangular grid defined by rows numbered from 1 to 5 and columns numbered from 1 to 6, establishing a coordinate system where positions are identified by an (x, y) pair, with x indicating the column and y indicating the row. There is a single player role called "robot," who takes turns sequentially, and the game begins with an initial state where a piece identified as a "knight" is positioned at cell (1, 1) and several cells are designated as "holes." The game keeps track of the number of moves made, starting at zero. On each turn, the robot may perform exactly one action or pass by performing a no-operation, though the rules provided focus on the move action. Each action by the robot consists of moving the knight from one cell to another, represented as a move from coordinates (x1, y1) to (x2, y2). A move is legal only if the knight currently occupies the starting cell (x1, y1) and the move corresponds to a valid knight's move pattern from chess: this means the move must be either two steps in one axis and one step in the other, in any direction, ensuring the destination cell is reachable by such an L-shaped jump. Moves must stay within the boundaries of the board, implicitly constrained by the defined rows and columns, and the destination cell can be a hole or any other cell on the board. Upon performing a move, the knight relocates to the destination cell (x2, y2), the origin cell loses the knight, and the hole at the destination cell is filledâ€”effectively removing the hole from that position. The move count increments by one after each move. The game ends (i.e., reaches a terminal state) once the knight occupies a cell and that cell is also a hole, meaning the knight has moved onto a hole cell. The scoring system assigns points based on the number of moves made, with a predefined score map where the score increases incrementally with each move count, reaching up to 100 points at 30 moves. The robot's goal is to maximize this score, which is determined by the current move count according to this mapping. Thus, the player maneuvers the knight around the board, moving in legal knight steps onto holes, filling them as the game progresses, and accumulating points until the game ends when the knight lands on a hole cell, signifying the conclusion of gameplay.
