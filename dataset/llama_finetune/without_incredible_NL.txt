The game takes place in an environment defined by four interconnected cells arranged in a cycle—w, x, y, and z—where adjacency relations connect w to x, x to y, y to z, and z back to w. The temporal progression of the game is tracked by steps labeled c1 through c20, sequentially ordered so that each step is the successor of the previous one. There is a single player role called "robot," which acts alone and takes turns sequentially through the steps. The initial state sets the robot's position at cell w, marks the gold as present at cell y, and establishes a set of blocks with positional relationships: block c is on a, e is on d, and f is on e; blocks a, b, and d are positioned on tables, and certain locations are clear, specifically b, c, and f.

Each turn, the robot must perform an action, with the option to effectively pass by performing a "noop" or equivalent move, ensuring continuous turn control. Legal actions include moving to an adjacent cell, grabbing the gold if it is in the robot's current cell, dropping gold the robot is holding, stacking a clear block onto another clear block that rests on a table, unstacking a clear block from atop another block, and contemplating pairs of adjacent positions. An action is legal only if its preconditions hold: for example, moving requires adjacency, grabbing requires gold presence at the robot's cell, dropping requires possession of the gold, stacking requires both source and destination blocks to be clear with the destination on a table, and unstacking requires the source block to be clear and positioned on another block. Contemplation requires pairs of adjacent cells. The robot cannot violate implicit constraints such as moving beyond the four defined cells or stacking onto occupied or non-clear blocks.

State changes occur automatically based on the robot's actions: moving updates the robot's cell to an adjacent position, grabbing transfers gold possession to the robot and removes it from the cell, dropping places the gold at the robot's current cell, stacking and unstacking update the "on" relationships between blocks, and contemplation does not change the board state but may represent a cognitive or planning step. The step counter increments with each turn, advancing from c1 up to c20. The game terminates if the step count reaches c20 or if the gold is at cell w, the starting position.

Victory conditions depend on the arrangement of blocks forming specific towers and the location of the gold. Two towers are recognized: the "bdftower," completed if block d is on f and b is on d, and the "caetower," completed if a is on e and c is on a. The robot's goal score varies according to whether gold is at w and which towers are completed. The highest score of 100 is awarded if the gold is at w and both towers are completed; lesser scores are given for partial completions or gold absence, down to zero if neither tower is complete, the gold is not at w, and the step count reaches c20. Thus, the robot aims to maneuver blocks to build these towers and retrieve the gold to cell w within the given steps to maximize its score and achieve victory.
