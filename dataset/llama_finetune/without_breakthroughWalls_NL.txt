The game is played on an 8-by-8 grid with coordinates defined by x and y indices ranging from 1 to 8, where the coordinate system uses (x, y) pairs to identify each cell. There are two players, White and Black, who alternate turns with White moving first, indicated initially by control assigned to White. The initial configuration places White's pieces occupying all cells in the first two rows (y=1 and y=2) and Black's pieces occupying all cells in the last two rows (y=7 and y=8), such that each cell in these rows holds a piece of the respective player. On a player's turn, they may either make a move or pass by executing a noop action, however, a noop is only legal for White when it is Black's turn and for Black when it is White's turn, effectively forcing the player whose turn it is to make a move. A legal move for White consists of moving one of their pieces forward from (x, y1) to (x, y2) where y2 is the immediate successor of y1 (that is y2 = y1 + 1), provided the destination cell is empty; alternatively, White may move diagonally forward to either the right or left by moving from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) where y2 = y1 + 1 and x2 is the immediate successor or predecessor of x1 (depending on board boundaries), capturing any opposing piece present there, but not onto a cell occupied by another White piece. Black's legal moves mirror White's but in the opposite direction: Black pieces move downwards from (x, y1) to (x, y2) where y2 is the predecessor of y1 (y2 = y1 - 1), either straight forward into an empty cell or diagonally forward left or right into a cell not occupied by another Black piece, potentially capturing a White piece. Moves must respect board boundaries, and pieces cannot move outside the 1-to-8 range in either coordinate or onto cells occupied by friendly pieces; diagonal moves require the destination cell to not contain a piece of the moving player. After a move, the piece is relocated accordingly, the previous cell becomes empty, and control passes to the opposing player. The game terminates when either White achieves a winning condition by having any of their pieces occupy any cell in the eighth row (y=8), or when Black achieves a winning condition by having any of their pieces occupy any cell in the first row (y=1). Additionally, a player wins if the opponent has no remaining pieces on the board. Victory is scored at 100 points for the winning player and 0 for the loser. The game enforces distinctness of cells so that moves cannot occur within the same cell, and the successor relations define allowable moves in both vertical and horizontal directions, except that certain horizontal transitions involving the fourth column are disallowed to maintain proper movement constraints. Thus, the game is a turn-based abstract strategy contest where each player attempts to advance their pieces forward to the opponent's home row or to eliminate all opposing pieces, with moves restricted to single-step forward or diagonal captures within the bounded grid, and turns alternating with forced moves or passes as dictated by the control state.
