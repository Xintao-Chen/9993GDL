This game is set on a grid-based board where each cell is identified by a row and a column number, both drawn from a defined numerical range with successor relations establishing order among these numbers. The environment starts with all cells marked as blank, and the single player role, known as the robot, takes turns placing queens onto the board. The initial game state is characterized by a placing counter set to one, indicating the first queen placement. On each turn, the robot must place a queen on a cell that is currently blank, with the legality of the action contingent on the cell's vacancy. The action format consists of the robot choosing to place a queen at a specific row and column coordinate. Each successful placement updates the board by marking the chosen cell as occupied by a queen, while all other cells remain unchanged. After a queen is placed, the placing counter increments by one, guiding the progression toward the game's end. The game continues this turn-by-turn placement process until the placing counter indicates that all required queens have been positioned, at which point the game terminates. The board's boundaries and numerical order implicitly constrain cell coordinates, preventing placements outside the defined grid. Additionally, no two queens may occupy the same cell, ensuring that placement actions cannot target already occupied positions. The game includes an automatic evaluation of whether any queen is under attack; a queen is considered attacked if another queen shares its row, column, or diagonal, determined by arithmetic relations on their coordinates. If any queen is attacked at the end of the game, the robot receives a score of zero; otherwise, it achieves the maximum score of one hundred. Thus, the victory condition requires the robot to place queens so that none threaten each other according to the rules governing attacks, effectively embodying an n-queens puzzle on a numbered grid.
