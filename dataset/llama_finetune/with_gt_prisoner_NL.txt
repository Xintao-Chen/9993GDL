This game is played between two players, designated as white and black, within a turn-based framework that lasts for a maximum of 20 rounds. The environment does not involve a spatial coordinate system or board layout but instead focuses on sequential rounds and score tracking. Both players simultaneously select one of two possible actions each round: defect or cooperate. At the start of the game, both players’ scores are initialized to zero, and the round counter begins at zero. Each round increments this counter by one, and the game proceeds until the round number reaches the preset maximum of 20, at which point the game terminates. On each turn, both players must choose either defect or cooperate; no-operation (noop) moves are not defined, so an action is always required. The legality of an action depends solely on whether the game has ended; actions are allowed only while the current round is less than the maximum. The result of the players’ combined actions determines the score increments for each player, following a payoff structure akin to the classic prisoner's dilemma: if one defects while the other cooperates, the defector’s score increases by five and the cooperator’s score remains unchanged; if both cooperate, each gains three points; if both defect, each gains one point. Scores accumulate over rounds, and the round counter advances by one after every pair of actions. There are no spatial or occupancy constraints since the game does not involve a board or pieces; only the temporal sequence of rounds and the players’ choices matter. The game ends automatically when the 20th round is completed, and the final scores of white and black are used to determine the outcome. The player with the higher score at the end of the final round is effectively the winner, with the scoring explicitly represented as goal values for each player corresponding to their final accumulated score.
