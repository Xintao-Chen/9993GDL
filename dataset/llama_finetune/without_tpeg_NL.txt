The game Jumper is played on a grid defined by rows labeled a through g and columns labeled c1 through c7, creating a coordinate system where each hole is identified by a row and column pair. The board initially contains pegs placed in nearly all holes except for a single empty hole at position c3 in row c. The player, assigned the role "jumper," takes turns performing actions with the objective of reducing the number of pegs on the board. There is only one player in this game, and they make moves sequentially. Each turn, the player may either perform a jump action or commit suicide to end the game prematurely. A jump action is specified by four coordinates: the starting hole row and column, and the destination hole row and column. A jump is legal only if the starting hole contains a peg, the destination hole is empty, and there is a middle hole between the start and destination that also contains a peg. The middle hole must be exactly between the start and destination either horizontally in the same row or vertically in the same column, with adjacency defined by the successor and predecessor relations on rows and columns. When a jump is executed, the peg in the starting hole moves to the destination hole, the peg in the middle hole is removed (making it empty), and the starting hole becomes empty. The number of pegs decreases by one with each successful jump. The player may choose to commit suicide only during the first four moves, which immediately ends the game and marks the player as dead. The game terminates when no more legal moves are possible, the player commits suicide, or only one peg remains on the board. Scoring is determined by the number of pegs left, with a maximum score of 100 for having a single peg remaining, and decreasing scores assigned as the number of pegs increases. If the player dies by suicide, a fixed score of 15 is assigned. The board enforces implicit constraints such as the boundaries of rows and columns and occupancy conflicts that prevent illegal jumps or moves outside the grid. The player must carefully plan moves to jump pegs over others, removing them until the terminal condition is reached to maximize the score.
