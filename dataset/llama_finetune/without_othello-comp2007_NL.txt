This game is played on an 8-by-8 grid with coordinates labeled from 1 to 8 along both the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) axes, forming the board environment. Two players participate, identified as black and red, who alternate turns with black moving first. The initial setup places four pieces in the center of the board: black pieces at positions (4,4) and (5,5), and red pieces at (4,5) and (5,4), with black having the initial control to make a move. On each turn, the player in control may take a legal action to mark a cell by placing their piece at coordinates (x,y) if that cell is open and the move results in flipping at least one of the opponent's pieces according to the gameâ€™s flipping rules, which involve line sequences of opponent pieces bounded by player pieces in any of the eight directions (north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest). If the player has no legal moves available, they must perform a noop action to pass their turn. Additionally, if the opponent has no legal moves on their subsequent turn, they too must noop, allowing the original player to continue. The marking action updates the board by placing the player's piece at the specified cell and flipping all appropriate opponent pieces that are enclosed between the newly placed piece and another piece of the current player along valid directions. The turn then passes to the opponent unless they have no legal moves, in which case control remains with the current player. Moves are constrained by the board boundaries, requiring all coordinates for placement and flipping to lie within the 1-to-8 range on both axes, and by the occupancy rule that a move can only be made on an empty cell. The game terminates when neither player has any legal moves remaining, at which point the winner is determined by counting the number of pieces each player controls on the board. The player with the greater number of pieces is awarded a victory score of 100, the player with fewer pieces receives 0, and in the event of a tie, both players receive a score of 50. Thus, the game embodies a turn-based strategy focused on area control through piece placement and flipping mechanics, with the outcome decided by final piece majority on the grid.
