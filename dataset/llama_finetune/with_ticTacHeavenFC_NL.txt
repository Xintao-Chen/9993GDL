The game is played on a hierarchical 3-by-3 grid system consisting of smaller cells arranged within larger boards, each indexed by coordinates from 1 to 3 along both rows and columns. There are two players, named xplayer and oplayer, who alternate turns controlling both the smaller cells and the larger boards. Initially, all small cells start blank, marked as 'b', and control of both small cells and large boards is assigned to xplayer. The game begins in a special first turn state during which players may perform various named actions such as factorize, dance, cry, laugh, sing, frolic, or twist. After this, players take turns making moves. Each turn, a player can either place their mark ('x' for xplayer, 'o' for oplayer) on a blank small cell that they are allowed to mark, or perform a move on the larger board by playing a large move to claim a cell within a larger board grid. The legality of marking a small cell depends on it being blank, the player having control over small cells, and certain conditions related to inhibition and factorization being satisfied; players may also choose to take a noop action, which is always legal and effectively passes their turn without changing the state. When a player marks a small cell, that cell's state updates to reflect the player's mark, and the control of small cells and large boards alternates between players after each move. The state also tracks inhibition of small cells based on moves made on the larger board, restricting marking options accordingly. Marking a large cell is only legal if the player controls the large board, the targeted larger cell is empty, and either it is the first large move or the current board corresponds to the move's coordinates, or the current board is closed. The game automatically updates the state after each move, including marking cells, toggling control, and recording board control and inhibition states. The implicit constraints include the 3-by-3 grid boundaries for both small and large cells, occupancy rules preventing marking occupied cells, and inhibition rules that restrict marking certain small cells after large moves. The game ends when a terminal condition is met, which occurs if either player achieves a line of three marks in a row, column, or diagonal on either the small or large boards, or when no empty small or large cells remain open. Victory is determined by the presence of such lines: a player receives a full score of 100 for completing a line on the small or large board, 50 if the board is full without any lines (a draw), and 0 if the opponent has completed a line. The final goal scores for each player reflect these conditions, and the terminal states trigger the end of the game. Thus, play proceeds with players alternately marking cells or passing until one achieves a winning line or the boards are filled, with scoring based on the lines formed on both levels of the grid hierarchy.
