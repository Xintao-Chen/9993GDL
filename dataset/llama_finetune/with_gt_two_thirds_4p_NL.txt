The game is set in an abstract environment with no spatial coordinates or traditional board layout, instead revolving around four players named player1, player2, player3, and player4, who take turns in a fixed order corresponding to their roles. At the start, none of the players have made any guesses. During each turn, the current player must perform a guess action by selecting a number between 0 and 100 inclusive; this guess is the only legal move allowed for that player when it is their turn. The game proceeds sequentially with each player making exactly one guess, and the game ends immediately after the first guess is made by any player, marking the terminal condition. The action of guessing records the player's chosen number as their guess in the next state. The core mechanics involve calculating the sum of all players' guesses and then determining two-thirds of the average of these guesses, with the average computed by dividing the total sum by four (the number of players). Each player's closeness score is computed as the absolute difference between their individual guess and this two-thirds average. The player whose guess is closest to this value is identified as the closest player, while others are considered not closest. The victory condition awards the player who is closest a goal score of 100, while all other players receive zero. Implicit constraints include that guesses must be within the allowed numeric range and only one guess per player is recorded; since the game ends after the first guess, in practice, only that initial guess is considered for scoring. There is no explicit noop action because players must guess on their turn, and the game concludes right after the initial guess, making further turns irrelevant. The game’s progression and state changes are dictated entirely by the sequence of guesses, the summation of these guesses, and the calculation of closeness to the two-thirds average, culminating in a single player’s victory or others’ losses based on this proximity metric.
