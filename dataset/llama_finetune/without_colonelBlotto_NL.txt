The game is played on a coordinate system where each coordinate is an integer index ranging from 0 to 10, and actions involve triplets of these indices whose sum must equal 10. Two players participate in the game, designated as white and black, with white taking the first turn followed by black, alternating thereafter. The initial state sets both players' scores to zero and the round count to zero, with a maximum of five rounds specified. On each turn, a player selects an action called "troops," which consists of three indices whose sum is exactly ten, ensuring each index is within the allowed range from 0 to 10. Both players must submit their "troops" actions simultaneously each round, and all actions are legal only if the sum condition and index bounds are satisfied; there is no explicit noop action defined. After both players have chosen their triplets, the game automatically computes new scores for each player based on comparisons of their respective coordinate values in the chosen triplets: for each position in the triplet, if the white player's index is greater than the black player's corresponding index, white gains 2 points and black gains 0 points; if black's index is greater, black gains 2 points and white gains none; if the indices are equal, both players gain 1 point each. These point values for each position in the triplet are summed to update the players' scores cumulatively. The round counter increments by one after each pair of moves, and the game terminates when the number of rounds reaches the maximum of five. At termination, the final scores of the white and black players determine the outcome, with the players' goals corresponding directly to their accumulated scores; the player with the higher score is considered the winner. Implicit constraints include the requirement that the three indices chosen by each player sum to exactly 10 and lie within the range 0 to 10, enforcing a balanced selection of troop distributions. The game thus centers on strategic allocation of troop strengths across three positions per round, rewarding players who allocate higher values in comparison to their opponent, and lasting exactly five rounds before final scoring concludes the match.
