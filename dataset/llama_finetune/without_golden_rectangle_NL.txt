The game takes place on a grid-based board with columns numbered from 1 to 7 and rows numbered from 0 to 6, forming a coordinate system where each cell is identified by its column and row indices. Initially, the bottom row (row 0) from columns 1 through 7 is filled with dirt cells, while all other cells above (rows 1 to 6) in columns 1 through 7 contain blank spaces denoted by 'b'. There are two players, red and yellow, who alternate turns with red taking the first move. On a player's turn, if it is their control phase, they may perform an action called "mark" by selecting a cell that currently contains dirt; this action is legal only if the player controls the turn and the targeted cell is dirt. The "mark" action updates the chosen cell to the player's color—red or yellow—depending on who marked it. Additionally, the dirt cell immediately above the marked cell (i.e., the cell in the same column but one row higher, provided it is within the board boundaries up to row 7) is converted from dirt to blank space 'b', simulating the clearing of dirt from beneath. All other cells remain unchanged unless affected by these rules. If it is not a player's turn to move, that player may only perform a no-operation ("noop") action, which is legal only when there is at least one dirt cell remaining on the board, ensuring turns continue until no dirt remains or a winning condition is met. Control alternates strictly between red and yellow after each action, with red starting the game. The game terminates when either player forms a rectangle composed of four cells of their color arranged at the corners of a rectangle within the board, or when there are no dirt cells left to mark. The rectangle must span at least four columns and four rows as defined by the checkDist and checkRect predicates, ensuring the rectangle is of minimum size and properly aligned on the grid. At termination, the player who has successfully formed such a rectangle is declared the winner with a score of 100, while the opponent scores 0. If the game ends without any player forming a rectangle and no dirt cells remain, yellow is considered the winner and scores 100, while red scores 0. Implicit constraints include that all cell coordinates must lie within the defined board boundaries, actions can only be performed on dirt cells, and the succession relations govern the vertical adjacency for the dirt clearing mechanic. Thus, the game revolves around strategic marking of dirt cells to build a rectangle of one's color while removing dirt above, with players alternating moves and the possibility of passing via noops when it is not their turn.
