The game is played on an 8-by-6 grid defined by coordinates from 1 to 8 along the x-axis (columns) and 1 to 6 along the y-axis (rows), where the bottom row is y=1 and the top y=6. There are two players, red and black, who alternate turns in two separate modes or phases referred to as "normal" and "suicide," each controlling the play in turn. Initially, both control states start with red having the move in normal mode. On each turn, a player either performs a drop action or, if it is not their turn in either mode, they must choose the noop action, which is legal only when the player is not in control in either mode. A legal drop action consists of placing a disc into a column that has at least one open cell at the topmost unoccupied position within that column for the mode in question; the action format is either drop_normal or drop_suicide followed by the column number, and a drop is legal only if that column is open in the respective mode and the player has control in that mode. When a disc is dropped into a column, it occupies the lowest unoccupied cell in that column, either at row 1 if the column is empty or the next open row above the existing discs, updating the corresponding cell state for that mode. After a move, control passes to the opposing player in the same mode, alternating between red and black in normal and suicide modes independently. The game enforces implicit constraints such as no disc can be placed outside the defined board boundaries of columns 1 through 8 and rows 1 through 6, discs stack vertically without gaps, and no cell can be occupied by more than one disc. The game terminates when either player forms a line of four consecutive discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in the current mode's board or when the board is full with no open columns remaining. The line is defined by four cells in succession either in a row, a column, or along either diagonal direction. Scoring depends on the mode and outcome: in normal mode, a player who forms a line wins with a score of 100, if neither player has a line and the board is full, both score 50, and if the opponent forms a line first or the board is still open with no line, the score is zero. In suicide mode, the scoring is inverted so that forming a line results in zero points for that player and 100 for the opponent, and filling the board without a line yields 50 points for both. The overall game ends when either the normal or suicide mode reaches a terminal state, and the final goals and scores are derived accordingly from whichever mode triggered the termination.
