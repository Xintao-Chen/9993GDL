The game is set on a grid defined by six indices numbered from 1 through 6, creating a coordinate system where positions are referenced by pairs of these indices. Two players participate, designated as xplayer and oplayer, who alternate turns in a fixed sequence starting with xplayer. The initial state has both players with zero boxes claimed and control assigned to xplayer. On their turn, the player in control must draw a line between two adjacent points on the grid that are not yet connected by a line; these lines can be either vertical or horizontal and must connect indices that are consecutive in the predefined order. The legality of a draw action depends on the control of the player and the absence of an existing line between the specified coordinates. If a player is not in control, their only legal action is to do nothing (noop). Each drawn line updates the game state by marking that line as present. When a drawn line completes the four sides of a box, that box is considered formed and attributed to the player who completed it. The player's box count increases accordingly, which can be one or two boxes if multiple boxes are formed simultaneously. If any box is formed during a turn, the player retains control and takes another turn; otherwise, control passes to the opposing player. The game enforces implicit constraints such as board boundaries by limiting lines to those connecting adjacent indices and prevents overlapping lines by disallowing drawing lines where one already exists. The game ends when there are no undrawn lines left, signifying that all possible connections have been made. Victory is determined by comparing the number of boxes each player has claimed: the player with the greater count wins, while a tie results in a win for oplayer. Scores are assigned accordingly, granting 100 points for a win and zero for a loss. Throughout, the game maintains a logical sequence for indices to assess adjacency and progression, ensuring consistent and valid moves within the grid structure.
