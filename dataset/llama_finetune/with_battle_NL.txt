The game takes place on an 8-by-8 coordinate grid with coordinates numbered from 1 to 8 along both axes, forming the game board. Two players, designated as north and south, alternate turns, starting with north. The initial state sets the step counter to zero and initializes each player's capture count to zero. The board is populated with pieces belonging to each player: north controls pawns labeled np and kings labeled nk, while south controls pawns labeled sp and kings labeled sk. Pieces are positioned on specific cells at the start, with pawns and kings placed on predetermined rows and columns as per the initial configuration. During a player's turn, they may perform one legal action: either moving a piece or defending a cell. The "noop" or no-operation is implicitly represented by the defend action, which allows a player to maintain control over a piece's current cell without moving it. Legal moves require that the player owns the piece being moved, the origin and destination coordinates lie within the board boundaries, and the destination cell is not already owned by the same player. Moreover, the piece being moved must adhere to its movement rules: kings may move to any adjacent cell horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (within one step in any direction), while pawns may move only one step orthogonally (either one step in the x-direction or one step in the y-direction) but not diagonally, and the move must involve a change in position (the origin and destination cannot be the same cell). The board enforces occupancy and movement constraints such that no two pieces occupy the same cell, and no player may move onto a cell occupied by their own piece. After a move is executed, if the destination cell was occupied by an opponent's piece and that piece was not defended or moved away in the same turn, a capture is registered, incrementing the moving player's capture count by one. Defending a cell prevents captures on that cell during the opponent's next move. The game automatically advances the step counter by one after each turn. The game ends under any of three terminal conditions: when the step count reaches 30, when a player has no pieces left on the board, or when a player reaches a capture count of 10, corresponding to a maximum score. Players earn points based on the number of captures they have achieved, with each capture worth 10 points up to a maximum of 100 points. The player with the highest score or the last remaining pieces on the board is deemed the winner. Thus, gameplay involves strategic movement and defense of pieces within the bounded 8x8 grid, turn-by-turn advancement, and capture mechanics that influence scoring and ultimately determine victory.
