The game is played on a board divided into four quadrants, each containing a 3x3 grid indexed by coordinates 1 through 3 for both rows and columns, resulting in global positioning that accounts for quadrant offsets. Two players, designated as red and black, alternate turns in a fixed sequence starting with red placing a piece, followed by black placing a piece, then red rotating a quadrant, then black rotating a quadrant, and so forth. The initial state grants red the control to place a piece first. On a player's turn, if they have placement control, they may place one of their pieces on any empty cell within any quadrant; if they have rotation control, they may rotate one quadrant of the board either clockwise or counterclockwise. If a player does not have either placement or rotation control, they must perform a noop action. Each action must be legal: a placement must target an empty cell within the board boundaries, and a rotation must specify a valid quadrant and direction. Placing a piece updates the cell to be held by that player; rotating a quadrant rearranges the pieces within that quadrant according to the specified rotation direction, transforming coordinates accordingly. Following each action, control passes from placement phase to rotation phase or vice versa, cycling between players in the order red place, black place, red rotate, black rotate, and so forth. The board's boundaries and occupancy rules prevent placing pieces outside the board or on occupied cells. The game ends when either player forms a line of five consecutive pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally across the global board, or when no empty cells remain on the board. Lines are detected by mapping quadrant-relative coordinates to global coordinates and checking sequences of five aligned pieces held by the same player, including all rows, columns, and both diagonal directions. Scoring assigns 100 points to a player who achieves a line while the opponent does not, zero points if the opponent has a line and the player does not, and 50 points if both have lines simultaneously or if the board is full without a line. If the game is still ongoing with no lines and empty cells remain, both players have zero points. This structure ensures a strategic interplay of placement and rotation phases, with the goal of aligning five consecutive pieces to win.
