This game is played on a 9-by-9 grid where each cell is identified by coordinates ranging from 1 to 9 in both the horizontal (file) and vertical (rank) directions, establishing a coordinate system with files numbered 1 through 9 and ranks numbered 1 through 9. The board initially contains a single hero character positioned at cell (5,5) and six zombies placed at specific cells: (1,3), (9,7), (7,1), (3,9), (1,1), and (9,9). The game involves only one player role, the hero, who takes turns acting alone. Turns alternate between two phases named "move" and "shoot," beginning with the "move" phase at step one. During the "move" phase, the hero may move to an adjacent cell—one step up, down, left, or right—or choose to perform a no-operation (movenoop), effectively passing the move phase without changing position. Movement is strictly constrained to adjacent cells within the board boundaries; the hero cannot move outside the 1-to-9 coordinate range. During the "shoot" phase, the hero may shoot at a zombie located along a straight, unobstructed line in one of eight directions (north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest) from the hero’s current position, or opt to perform a shooting no-operation (shootnoop). A shot is legal only if a zombie occupies a cell in line with the hero’s position and the path between hero and target is unobstructed by other pieces. The hero’s actions are represented as either move commands specifying the target cell coordinates, shoot commands specifying the target zombie’s cell coordinates, or corresponding no-operation commands. After the hero moves during the move phase, the zombies automatically respond by moving one cell closer to the hero along the shortest path, advancing towards the hero’s position if the hero has just moved, or remaining stationary if the hero performed a no-op or shot. Zombies cannot occupy the same cell as other zombies, and their movement respects the board boundaries. When the hero successfully shoots a zombie, that zombie is eliminated if it is the highest-indexed zombie in that cell; otherwise, the zombie with the next higher index remains, reflecting a hierarchy among zombies. New zombies enter the board in a cyclic sequence at predetermined cells corresponding to a circular count that increments each turn. The game keeps track of the number of zombies eliminated (bodycount), incrementing it each time the hero kills a zombie. The game proceeds in steps, incrementing each turn, with step counts tracked up to a maximum of 50. The game terminates under three conditions: when all zombies (20 in total) have been killed, when the hero loses brains (which occurs if a zombie occupies the same cell as the hero), or when 50 steps have elapsed. The hero scores 100 points for eliminating all zombies without losing brains, scores zero if brains are lost at any point, and scores 50 points otherwise if neither condition is met by the end of the game. Throughout play, the hero must avoid losing brains by preventing zombie occupation of the hero’s cell, and must strategically move and shoot to eliminate zombies while managing the cyclical arrival of new zombies on the board. The turn control mechanism enforces that the hero alternates moves and shoots in this fixed order, with the option to pass phases via no-operations, enabling the hero to plan positioning and attacks while zombies autonomously advance or spawn according to the game’s rules.
