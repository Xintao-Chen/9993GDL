This game is played between two players, white and black, who take turns simultaneously in each round. The environment is abstract and does not involve a spatial coordinate system; instead, it tracks numerical scores and rounds. Initially, both white and black start with a score of 50, and the round counter is set to 0. The game proceeds for a maximum of 5 rounds, with round number incrementing by one after each pair of bids. On each turn, both players must submit a bid action, which is a numerical value not exceeding their current score; bidding more than their available score is illegal. There is no explicit noop action defined, so players must always bid within their score limits. The bids are submitted simultaneously. The state updates at the end of each round depend on the minimum of the two bids made. If one player bids strictly higher than the other, the player who bids higher gains 10 points plus the minimum bid amount, while the other player gains only the minimum bid. If both players bid equally, each gains 5 points plus the minimum bid. Scores are updated by adding these values to the previous scores, and the round counter increments by one. Implicit constraints include that bids must be integers between 0 and the player's current score, and the game ends once the round counter reaches the maximum of 5. The victory condition is based on the scores at the end of the final round: each player's goal value equals their final score, effectively making the player with the higher score the winner. The game thus revolves around strategic bidding to maximize one's own score while limiting the opponent's gains within a limited number of rounds.
