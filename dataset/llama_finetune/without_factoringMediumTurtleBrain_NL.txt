The game is set on a board defined by coordinates where the first coordinate z ranges from 0 to 20, inclusive, and the second and third coordinates x and y take values 1 or 2, forming a grid of cells identified by (z, x, y). Each cell can hold an integer state value from 0 to 4, where all cells are initially set to 0. The only player role in the game is the robot, which takes turns sequentially, and the game proceeds in discrete steps starting from step 0. On each turn, the robot must perform an action called "press" specifying a triple of indices (z, x, y); this action is legal only if the z coordinate matches the current seriesGame value and x and y are within the index set {1, 2}. When the robot presses a cell, the state of that cell is immediately set to 4 on the next state update. Subsequently, on each following step, cell states automatically decrement by one until they reach 0 again, representing a countdown effect from 4 down to 0. The seriesGame value changes at specific step intervals—specifically at steps 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, and 80—incrementing by one at each of these milestones, thereby controlling which z coordinate is currently active and thus which cells can be pressed legally. The board enforces implicit constraints such that actions are only valid when targeting cells within the defined coordinate ranges; pressing outside these boundaries is not allowed. The game terminates automatically at step 84. A winning condition is defined by the presence of a "won" state for any z coordinate between 10 and 19, inclusive; this "won" condition is triggered when all four cells at coordinates (z, 1, 1), (z, 1, 2), (z, 2, 1), and (z, 2, 2) are simultaneously in a nonzero state (indicating they are "on"). The robot's goal is to achieve this winning configuration before the game ends. Upon termination, if the robot has successfully won a game, it scores 100 points; otherwise, it scores zero. There are no explicit noop moves specified, so the robot must act each turn with a valid press action corresponding to the current seriesGame value, and the game state progresses deterministically based on these actions and the automatic countdown of cell states. Thus, the game challenges the robot to strategically activate all four cells in a given z layer within the limited time frames defined by the step count increments before step 84 ends the game.
