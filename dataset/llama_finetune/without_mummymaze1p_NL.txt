The game takes place on a two-dimensional grid defined by indices ranging from 0 to 8 for both horizontal and vertical coordinates, creating a bounded board enclosed by walls along its edges and various internal walls positioned between cells. The coordinate system uses these indices to specify locations, with directions identified as north, south, east, west, and nowhere to indicate movement or orientation within the grid. Two player roles exist: the explorer and the mummy, with the explorer always taking the first turn followed by the mummy; turns alternate in this fixed order. At the start of the game, the explorer is located at coordinates (3,3), the mummy at (5,1), and the exit at (1,2), with the initial step count set to zero. Each turn, the explorer can perform an action to move one cell in any of the four cardinal directions, provided the movement is legal; legality requires that no wall blocks the path from the current cell in the chosen direction and that the destination lies within the board boundaries. The mummy’s move is defined by a two-step movement composed of two directional moves, each corresponding to a legal step toward the explorer's current location, again respecting walls and board limits. If a proposed move is blocked by a wall or would move an entity outside the grid, the entity remains in its current position, effectively a no-operation for that step. Actions are formatted as move commands specifying the direction to move for the explorer and a composite two-direction move for the mummy, with these actions constrained by the spatial layout and adjacency rules encoded via direction components and wall placements. After each action, the game state updates the positions of the explorer and mummy accordingly, increments the step counter, and maintains static positions for the exit and walls. The game implicitly enforces that no two entities can occupy the same cell unless it results in the explorer being "eaten" by the mummy, which occurs if both share the same coordinates after a move; this event triggers an immediate terminal condition. The game also ends if the explorer reaches the exit cell or when fifty steps have elapsed without either of these events occurring. Victory is determined by the final conditions: the explorer achieves a high score of 100 points by reaching the exit without being eaten, receives 50 points if neither reaching the exit nor being eaten occurs within the step limit, and scores zero if eaten. Conversely, the mummy scores zero if the explorer escapes safely, 50 points if the game ends without a definitive outcome, and 100 points if it successfully captures the explorer. This structure ensures a strategic pursuit game where the explorer aims to navigate the maze of walls to reach the exit, while the mummy attempts to intercept by moving two steps each turn toward the explorer’s position, with the game concluding upon escape, capture, or time expiration.
