The game is played on a uniquely indexed board with positions labeled from a1 through i1, arranged in a pattern that includes rows with varying numbers of cells, such as row c containing seven cells from c1 to c7, and row i containing a single cell i1. The coordinate system is based on these alphanumeric indices that denote cells on the board. Six players, identified by the colors red, yellow, green, teal, blue, and magenta, participate in the game. They take turns in a fixed cyclic order starting with red, then yellow, followed by green, teal, blue, magenta, and back to red. The initial state places several pieces belonging to each player on specific cells distributed across the board; for example, red occupies a1, b1, and b2, magenta occupies c1, c2, and d1, and so forth, with the first move designated to the red side and the game step counter starting at one. On each turn, the player whose turn it is may either perform a move action or choose to do nothing (noop). The move action involves moving a piece from one cell to another, with moves being legal only if they correspond to a sequence of one to four jumps over occupied adjacent cells according to player-specific movement patterns defined by relations analogous to "car" and "cdr" moves that specify allowed directions and distances. A jump requires an occupied intermediate cell and an empty destination cell, and moves must adhere to these adjacency and occupancy constraints. The game enforces board boundaries implicitly through the defined "car" and "cdr" relations, which restrict movements to valid neighboring cells. After a move, the piece is relocated to the target cell, and the original cell is vacated; any other cells not directly affected by the move retain their states. Turn control automatically advances to the next player in the cycle after each move or noop, and the step counter increments with each completed turn. The game terminates either when the step counter reaches 55 or when all six players have exactly three stones on their designated target cells, which are predefined specific triples of cells unique to each player. Scoring is determined by the total number of stones placed on these target cells collectively by all players, with a goal mapping translating the number of stones into a numeric score, where achieving 18 stones yields the highest score of 100 and fewer stones correspond to proportionally lower scores. The objective is therefore to strategically move pieces to occupy these target cells efficiently within the allowed moves and turns, with the victory conditions tied to the accumulation of stones in these key positions by the end of the game.
