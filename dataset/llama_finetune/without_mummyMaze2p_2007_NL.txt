The game is set on an 8-by-8 grid, where cells are identified by x and y coordinates ranging from 1 to 8, with the origin presumably at the bottom-left corner, and directions north, south, east, and west corresponding to increments or decrements in the y or x coordinates respectively. Two player roles exist: the explorer and the mummy, who alternate turns with the explorer moving first. Initially, the explorer starts at position (6,3), the mummy at (2,5), and there is an exit located at (1,3). Certain boundaries between cells are blocked either to the north or east, preventing movement across these edges. On each turn, the player in control may choose a move action; the explorer can move one step in a direction or choose to stay put (no-op) when it is not their turn, while the mummy can move exactly two steps in sequence, each in a legal direction, or do nothing if it is not its turn. A movement step is legal if it leads to an adjacent cell that is within the board limits, not blocked by any walls, and respects the occupancy constraints, notably that the mummy’s two-step move cannot end on the explorer’s starting cell of that turn to avoid overlap. The control alternates strictly between the explorer and the mummy after each move. Moving involves updating the player’s location based on the chosen directions, and the game state increments a step counter each turn. The game ends under one of three terminal conditions: the explorer is captured by occupying the same cell as the mummy, the explorer reaches the exit cell, or a timeout occurs after 50 steps. The explorer wins by reaching the exit without being captured, earning 100 points, or by surviving until timeout without being caught or exiting, earning 50 points; being captured or failing to reach the exit before timeout yields zero points. Conversely, the mummy wins by capturing the explorer, earning 100 points, or by surviving until timeout without the explorer exiting or being captured, earning 50 points; if the explorer exits safely or timeout occurs without capture, the mummy scores zero. Implicit constraints include blocked edges that prevent crossing from one cell to another in certain directions, the requirement that all moves remain within the bounds of the 8-by-8 grid, and that the mummy’s two-step move cannot land back on its starting cell or overlap with the explorer’s location during that turn. No-ops are only legal when the player does not have the control, serving as a mechanism to pass turns when it is not their move. Thus, the game challenges the explorer to navigate through a maze of blocked paths to reach the exit while evading the mummy who attempts to capture them by moving twice per turn.
