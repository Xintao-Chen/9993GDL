The game is played on two separate 3-by-3 grids, each with coordinates ranging from 1 to 3 along both the x and y axes, defining the cells within each grid. There are two players, named xplayer and oplayer, who alternate turns throughout the game. Initially, all cells in both grids are blank. Control initially rests with xplayer on both grids. During the first phase of the game, players take turns marking cells on the first grid, with xplayer starting. A legal move consists of marking a blank cell on the first grid, and only the player currently in control of the first grid may mark a cell there. If it is not a player's turn to control the first grid, that player may only pass by performing a no-operation move. After the first phase ends—determined by either a winning line being formed or no blank cells remaining on the first grid—the game transitions to the second grid, where players again alternate turns marking blank cells. In this second phase, players may only mark blank cells on the second grid if the first phase has concluded, and similar turn-taking and noop rules apply. Each move updates the state by placing the player's mark in the chosen cell, while all other cells retain their previous state unless the game has transitioned phases. Control switches between players after each move, except when the game phase changes, in which case control remains consistent with the rules. Throughout play, cells cannot be marked more than once, and all moves must respect the boundaries of the 3-by-3 grids. The game ends when a terminal condition is met on the second grid, which occurs if a player completes a winning line or no blank cells remain. Victory is determined by evaluating the presence of complete lines—rows, columns, or diagonals—of a player's marks on either grid, with higher scores awarded for winning lines and lesser scores for draws or losses, as defined by a detailed scoring system that considers both grids' outcomes. Thus, the gameplay consists of sequential marking on two tic-tac-toe boards, with strict turn order, state updates, and victory conditions that depend on forming lines or filling the boards without lines.
