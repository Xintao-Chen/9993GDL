The game takes place on a grid-based board where each cell is identified by a row and column number, with coordinates defined as numeric values starting from 1 upwards. The board cells can be in one of two states: blank or occupied by a queen. There is a single player role named "robot," who takes all the turns sequentially. The initial state sets all cells on the board as blank and begins with the robot in a "placing" phase, starting at 1. On each turn, the robot may place a queen on a blank cell that is not currently under attack; alternatively, the robot may choose to quit the game. Legal placement actions must specify the row and column coordinates of a blank cell that is not attacked, meaning it is not under threat from any queen already placed on the board. After a placement, the cell state updates to contain a queen, and the placing index increments by one; if the robot chooses to quit, the game enters a finished state. The concept of cells being "attacked" is determined by the presence of queens in the same row or column or diagonally aligned with the cell in question, using coordinate sums and differences to define diagonal attacks. The game enforces implicit constraints such as board boundaries defined by the numeric range of rows and columns, preventing placement outside the grid, and forbids placing a queen on any cell under attack or already occupied. The game terminates either when the robot chooses to quit or when there are no further placements to be made (no "still placing" phase remains). The scoring system awards the robot 100 points for successfully placing queens without quitting and 0 points if the robot quits before finishing. No other players participate, and no further moves are made after termination. Thus, the game challenges the robot to place queens on a grid without mutual attacks, reflecting a variant of the classic n-queens puzzle, with the option to end the game at any time by quitting.
