This game is played by a single player role called "robot" within a grid-based environment defined by rows and columns numbered sequentially from 1 upwards, with each cell initially blank. The coordinate system uses these row and column numbers to identify cells, and the initial state sets all cells to blank and establishes a placement counter starting at one. Players take turns in a sequence consisting solely of the robot, who on each turn may place a queen on any blank cell; the action format is "place" followed by the row and column numbers, and it is legal only if the targeted cell is currently blank. Upon placing a queen, the state updates that cell to hold a queen, while all other cells retain their previous contents, and the placement counter increments by one. The turn control progresses automatically with no explicit 'noop' action needed, as the robot must place a queen each turn until all placements are completed, indicated by the absence of an ongoing placing phase. Implicit constraints include that queens cannot be placed outside the predefined grid boundaries, and no cell may be occupied by more than one queen. A cell is considered attacked if it shares the same row, the same column, or the same diagonal with any placed queen, where diagonals are determined by equal sums or differences of row and column indices. The game terminates once the placing phase concludes, meaning no further placements remain. Scoring is binary: the robot scores zero if any queen is attacked by another, otherwise the robot scores 100 points, representing a successful configuration with no queens threatening each other.
