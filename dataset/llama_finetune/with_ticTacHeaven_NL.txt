This game takes place on a two-level board system with coordinates defined by indices 1 through 3 along both dimensions, effectively forming a 3x3 grid for each level. The smaller board consists of nine cells arranged in a 3x3 matrix where each cell can be empty or marked by either player 'x' or player 'o'. The larger board overlays this with an additional level of 3x3 grids, each containing its own 3x3 grid of cells, thus creating a nested board structure. The two players, named xplayer and oplayer, alternate turns starting with xplayer controlling both the small and large boards initially. On each turn, a player may either perform a marking action on the small board or play a move on the large board, depending on which board they currently control. The initial state has all small board cells empty and xplayer in control of both boards. Turn control alternates between the two players for both the small and large board actions. Players may also choose to pass by performing a noop action, which is always legal. Actions must conform to specific formats: marking a small cell is legal only if that cell is empty and the player currently controls the small board; playing a large board move involves specifying coordinates for the larger grid and the inner cell to mark, and is legal only if that cell is empty and either it is the first move or the move corresponds to the current board or the current board is closed (i.e., fully occupied). When a player marks a cell on the small board, that cell's state updates to the player's mark; similarly, playing on the large board updates the corresponding cell. Control switches to the opposing player after each move. The game enforces implicit constraints such as boundaries of the 3x3 grids at both levels, ensuring moves occur only within valid coordinates, and cells cannot be marked if already occupied. The game detects winning conditions by checking for any completed row, column, or diagonal of identical marks either on the small or the large boards. The game terminates when either player forms such a line on either board or when no empty cells remain on the respective board. Victory is scored by assigning 100 points to the player who completes a line, 0 points to the opponent, and 50 points to both if the board is full without a winning line. These goals are evaluated separately for the small and large boards, and the terminal condition arises from either board reaching a terminal state. Thus, the game combines nested board mechanics with turn-based marking, alternating control, and line-completion victory conditions on both small and large board levels.
