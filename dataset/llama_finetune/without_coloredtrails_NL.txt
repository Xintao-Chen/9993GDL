The game is played on a 4-by-4 grid with cells labeled from a1 to d4, organized such that columns run from 'a' to 'd' and rows from '1' to '4', with adjacency defined by cells being directly to the left or directly above another. Each cell is assigned a distinct color from red, green, yellow, and blue in a fixed pattern. There are two players, designated as white and black, who alternate turns starting with white. The initial configuration places the white player’s piece on cell a1, the black player's piece on cell d4, and all other cells are occupied by a neutral marker 'b'. Additionally, there are eight spots labeled s1 through s8, each associated with one of the four colors and initially owned by one of the players—white owns the red, green, yellow, and green spots s1 through s4, and black owns the yellow, yellow, blue, and blue spots s5 through s8. Two "open" slots named tw and tb start blank and are used to hold offers during the game. The game proceeds in discrete steps numbered from 1 to 10. On a player's turn, they may perform one of several legal actions: moving their piece from its current cell to an adjacent cell that is either directly left or above (in either direction) provided that the destination cell's color matches a spot owned by that player; offering a pair of spots (one owned by white and one owned by black) to be exchanged by placing them in the tw and tb open slots, respectively; accepting an offer when an offer is pending (i.e., when tw and tb contain non-blank spots); or passing. Moves result in the player's piece occupying the destination cell and the previous cell becoming neutral; offers place the selected spots into the open slots without changing the board; acceptance swaps the ownership of the two offered spots, updating the players’ spot ownership accordingly; passing leaves the state unchanged. Turn control alternates strictly between white and black each step. The game enforces implicit constraints such as the board boundaries which prevent moves outside the defined 4x4 grid and requires moves only between orthogonally adjacent cells. The noop mechanism is effectively represented by the pass action, allowing players to skip their turn if desired. The game terminates when either a player moves their piece onto cell a4, which immediately grants that player a victory with a score of 100, or when ten steps have elapsed without such an event, ending the game. The victory condition is solely determined by occupying cell a4; the player controlling that cell wins, while all other players receive zero points. Thus, the goal for each player is to maneuver their piece strategically across the board leveraging their spot ownership to move only onto cells matching colors of spots they own, potentially exchanging spots with the opponent through offers and acceptances to gain more advantageous movement options, all while aiming to reach cell a4 first or prevent the opponent from doing so within the allotted steps.
