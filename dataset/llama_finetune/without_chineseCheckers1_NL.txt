The game is played on a hexagonal-like coordinate grid with positions labeled from a1 through i1, arranged in rows of varying length, creating a non-rectangular board. The coordinate system uses letter-number pairs to identify each cell uniquely. There is a single player role named red, who controls pieces initially placed on cells a1, b1, and b2. The game proceeds in discrete steps, starting at step 1 and incrementing by one each turn, up to a maximum of step 40, which serves as one terminal condition. Each turn, the red player may choose either to make a move or perform a noop action, which is always legal for the player. Moves consist of relocating a piece from one occupied cell to another specific empty cell, following a set of movement rules defined by chains of adjacency relations called "car" and "cdr" that represent allowed paths on the board; these adjacency relations dictate which cells are reachable from others. A move is legal if it starts from a cell currently occupied by the player's piece and follows these adjacency patterns, requiring certain intermediate cells to be occupied or empty accordingly, effectively enforcing that pieces can only jump over other pieces or move to adjacent empty cells in specified configurations. When a move is made, the piece vacates its original cell, and the destination cell becomes occupied by the player's piece; all other cells remain unchanged unless affected by the move. The player may also choose noop, which results in no change to the board state but advances the game step counter. The game ends either when the step count reaches 40 or when the player's pieces occupy a specific trio of cells denoted h1, h2, and i1 simultaneously. Scoring is determined by the occupancy of these three particular cells: if all three are occupied by the player's pieces, the player scores 100 points, which also triggers game termination; if two of these cells are occupied, the player scores 50 points; if only one cell is occupied, the player scores 25 points; and if none are occupied, the score is zero. The objective is to maximize this score by positioning pieces strategically over the course of the turns, with victory achieved by reaching the highest possible score before the game ends either by step limit or by occupying all three target cells. Throughout the game, implicit constraints prevent moves off the board or onto occupied cells except as allowed by the movement rules, ensuring piece positions remain within the defined grid and respecting the occupancy and adjacency conditions at all times.
