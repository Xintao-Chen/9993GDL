The game is played between two players named white and black, who alternate turns in a fixed order beginning with white, then black, and so forth. The game proceeds in rounds, starting at round zero, and continues until a maximum of ten rounds is reached, at which point the game ends. The environment is abstract and does not specify a spatial coordinate system; instead, it uses an index ranging from 0 to 10 to represent discrete offer values that white can propose. At the start, both players have a score of zero, and white has control to make the first move. On white's turn, the only legal action is to offer a number between 0 and 10 inclusive, corresponding to the index, which represents a proposed division of a total value of 10. On black's subsequent turn, black must either accept or reject the offer made by white. If black accepts, the scores of both players are updated: white's score increases by the amount offered to white, and black's score increases by the complementary amount that sums with white's offer to 10. If black rejects, neither player's score changes. If it is not a player's turn to act, that player may perform a no-operation action (noop), which effectively passes control back to the other player without changing the game state. The control alternates between white and black after each action, ensuring turn-taking. The round number increments only after black completes their turn, signifying the completion of one full cycle of offers and responses. The game terminates automatically when the round count reaches the maximum of ten. The victory conditions are based on the final accumulated scores of the players: white's goal value equals white's total score, and black's goal value equals black's total score. Implicit constraints include that offers must be valid indices within the range 0 to 10, and that the sum of white's offer and black's corresponding share must always equal 10. There are no spatial or occupancy constraints beyond these numerical bounds. Overall, the game models a sequential bargaining scenario where white proposes a split of a fixed quantity, and black decides whether to accept or reject, influencing the final scores over a limited number of rounds.
