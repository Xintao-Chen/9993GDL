The Queens Puzzle game takes place on an NxN board, where players aim to place N queens such that none are attacking each other. The game environment is defined by a grid where each cell can either hold a queen or remain blank. The game features a single player role, the robot, who takes turns placing queens one at a time on the board. Initially, all cells are blank, and the player starts with the task of placing the first queen. Each turn involves the player placing a queen on a blank cell, ensuring that no two queens can attack each other. This constraint means that the player must avoid placing a queen in the same row, column, or diagonal as another queen. The format for each action is simply the placement of a queen at specified row and column coordinates, and it is only legal if the chosen cell is currently blank. Once a queen is placed, the cell is updated to reflect its new state as occupied by a queen, and the player proceeds to place the next queen. The game concludes when the player has placed all queens, with the implicit boundary constraints of the board limiting the possible placements. The player's goal is to ensure no queens are attacking each other; if successful, the player scores 100 points. However, if any queen is found to be under attack, the score drops to zero. The gameâ€™s mathematical and logical functions ensure that queens can only be placed legally, respecting the board's boundaries and the rules of queen movement in chess. The game becomes terminal once there are no more queens left to place, and the player's performance is evaluated based on whether all queens are safely placed without any conflicts.
