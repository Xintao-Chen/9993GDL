In the game of Connect Four - Win by Losing, players take on the roles of either "red" or "black," with "red" beginning the game. The game is set on a coordinate grid representing the Connect Four board, with columns numbered from 1 to 7 and rows also numbered from 1 to 7. The initial state sees "red" in control, and players alternate turns, with "red" going first. Each player can either make a move by dropping a token into one of the columns or perform a noop action, which is legal only when it is not that player's turn. A move is considered legal if the player in control drops a token into an open column. The state of the board changes automatically with each move: a token dropped into a column occupies the lowest available cell in that column. The control of the game switches to the other player after each turn. Implicit constraints include the boundaries of the board, as tokens must be placed within the 7x7 grid, and the requirement that tokens cannot be placed in full columns. The game reaches a terminal state when a player forms a line of four consecutive tokens horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when no more moves are possible because the board is full. Scoring is unique in this variant of Connect Four: a player wins by losing. If "red" forms a line, "black" scores 100, and vice versa. If no lines are formed and the board is full, both players score 50. When the board is not full and no lines are formed, both players receive a score of zero. Thus, the strategic aim is to force the opponent into winning by forming a line, achieving victory through a score of 100.
