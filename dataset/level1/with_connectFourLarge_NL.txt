The game of Connect Four Large is played on a grid with a coordinate system defined by columns labeled from 1 to 12 and rows from 1 to 9. Two players, referred to as 'red' and 'black,' take turns to drop their respective colored discs into the columns, with the initial player being 'red'. The game begins with 'red' in control, and players alternate turns, marked by the transition of control from one to the other. If a player does not have control, they execute a 'noop' action, essentially passing the turn. Each move consists of a 'drop' action in a column, which is only legal if the column is open. The game enforces implicit constraints such as ensuring a disc cannot be placed outside the board's boundaries, and a column is considered open only if its topmost cell is unoccupied. Upon dropping a disc, it automatically occupies the lowest available cell in the chosen column. The game reaches a terminal state when a player forms a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs, or when the board is completely filled with no open columns. A player wins by forming such a line, scoring 100 points, while the opponent scores zero. If the board fills up without any player forming a line, the game results in a draw, with both players scoring 50 points. The board's state is updated automatically after each action, ensuring the correct alternation of turns and maintaining the integrity of the game's rules.
