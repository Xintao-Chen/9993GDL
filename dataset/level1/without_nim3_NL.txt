The game is played by two participants, designated as player1 and player2, who take turns in a sequential manner. The initial setup consists of four heaps labeled a, b, c, and d, with respective quantities of 11, 12, 15, and 25 units. Player1 is the first to control the turn. During each turn, a player can perform a noop action to pass their turn, but only if they are not currently in control, or they can choose to reduce the size of one of the heaps by a quantity smaller than its current size. Legal actions are determined by whether the player is in control and whether the chosen reduction amount is less than the heap's current size. When a reduction action is taken, the state of the game changes as the specified heap's quantity is decreased, and the control of the turn shifts to the other player. The game imposes implicit constraints such as ensuring all heap quantities remain non-negative and that players can only interact with heaps currently available. The game reaches its terminal state when all heaps are reduced to zero. Scoring is straightforward: if the game ends while a player is in control, the controlling player scores zero, and the other player scores 100, determining the winner. The alternating control between players is regulated by a predefined order, ensuring fair play and adherence to the rules.
