The game is set on a grid-like environment where there are eight positions, labeled p1 through p8, each initially occupied by a disk of either green or red color. Specifically, positions p1, p2, p5, and p7 hold green disks, while positions p3, p4, p6, and p8 contain red disks. The player assumes the role of "taker" and takes turns to either remove a green disk or reset the board. The initial state of the game is defined with these specific disk placements and a reset state labeled s0. Players interact with the game via legal actions, which include removing a disk from a position if it is green, or resetting the board to its initial state. The 'noop' mechanism allows the player to pass their turn without any action. The legal actions trigger state changes whereby a removed green disk results in that position becoming empty, and the removal of a disk can affect adjacent positions, potentially changing the color of adjacent disks. Adjacent relationships are specified, such as between p1 and p2 or p7 and p8, creating implicit constraints on how actions impact the board. The game concludes when all positions are empty or when the reset state reaches s3, marking terminal conditions. Victory is determined by achieving a state where all positions are cleared and the reset state is s0, granting the player a score of 100. If the reset state is s1 or s2, the score is 66 or 33, respectively. Achieving a reset state of s3 results in a score of 0, indicating a loss. The game thus requires strategic removal of disks and effective use of the reset function to maximize the score before reaching terminal conditions.
