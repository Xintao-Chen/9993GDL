In the game "LightsOn," the environment is set on a two-by-two grid with coordinates ranging from (1, 1) to (2, 2), and each cell initially holds a state value of 0. The sole player in the game is assigned the role of a robot, which takes turns to interact with the grid. The game begins with all cells in the state of 0, and a step counter initialized at 0. During each turn, the robot has the option to perform a "press" action on any cell, provided the coordinates are within the defined indices of 1 and 2. This action is considered legal if it falls within these bounds, and the robot executes it by changing the state of the targeted cell to 4. The state of each cell automatically decreases by one in subsequent steps unless a press action resets it to 4. The game also provides a "noop" mechanism where no action is taken, allowing turns to pass without a state change. Implicit constraints include the boundaries of the grid, as actions are only legal within the specified coordinates, and there are no occupancy conflicts since the robot interacts with the grid rather than occupying it. The game reaches a terminal state either when 20 steps have been completed or when all cells have a state greater than 0, at which point the grid is considered fully lit. The robot wins the game and receives a perfect score of 100 points if all cells are lit, which is termed as "lightsOn," whereas if the game ends without achieving this, the robot scores 0 points. The game is a strategic puzzle where the player must efficiently manage the state changes of the grid cells within the turn limit to achieve the highest score.
