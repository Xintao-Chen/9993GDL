The game called "Haystack" is set in an environment defined by a coordinate system where various positions, such as h1, h2, up to h8, determine the state of the game. The only player role in this game is that of a robot. Initially, the game begins at position h1. The robot can choose from a set of actions labeled a, b, c, or d, depending on its current position, with specific legal actions available at particular states. For instance, actions a and b are allowed when the game state is h1. The robot progresses from one state to another based on these actions, triggering automatic state changes, such as moving from h1 to h2 when action a is executed, or from h5 to h6 when action a is executed from h5. The game incorporates a noop mechanism, meaning the robot can opt to do nothing if no legal move is available, although this is not explicitly detailed in the game's progression. The game's actions must respect implicit constraints, such as the boundaries of the board, which are defined by the positions h1 through h8, and ensure no conflicting occupancy occurs within these positions. The game reaches its terminal state when position h3 or h8 is occupied, thus ending the gameplay. Scoring in the game is straightforward: the robot scores 100 points upon reaching position h3, which is one of the victory conditions, while any other outcome results in a score of zero. The victory is determined by whether the robot achieves the goal state of h3, concluding the game with a win if successful.
