In this game of Tic-Tac-Toe, two players, designated as the xplayer and the oplayer, take turns marking positions on a 3x3 grid, which is initially set with all positions, labeled from 'a' to 'i', being blank. The xplayer begins the game with control, and players alternate turns thereafter. Each player can either mark a blank position or perform a noop action when it is not their turn to play. The legal actions involve marking a position that is currently blank, and each player must respect the control order, which alternates between xplayer and oplayer. The grid boundaries implicitly constrain player actions, ensuring that marks must be made within the nine designated positions, and only on unoccupied spaces to avoid conflicts. A player wins by forming a line of three of their marks along any row, column, or diagonal, which are predefined as winning line conditions. The game reaches a terminal state when either player achieves this, or when there are no open positions left on the board. If xplayer creates a line of three 'X's, they achieve a score of 100, while oplayer receives 0, and vice versa if oplayer forms a line of 'O's. In the event of a draw—where no player forms a line and no spaces remain unmarked—both players receive a score of 50. The game is a classic zero-sum game where the victory conditions are clearly defined by these scoring rules and the terminal conditions ensure a conclusive end to each match.
