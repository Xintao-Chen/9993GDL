The game of Gomoku, as implemented here, is played on a 15x15 grid where two players, black and white, take turns placing their pieces. The initial state of the game grants control to the player with the black pieces, establishing the order of play as black first, followed by white. A player's turn involves placing a piece at an empty coordinate on the board, and this action is only legal if the player currently has control and the chosen cell is unoccupied. If a player does not have control, they can perform a noop, essentially passing their turn. The game alternates control between players after each valid move. The board's boundaries are implicitly constrained by the coordinate indices ranging from 1 to 15, ensuring that no move can be made outside this grid. A move triggers state changes by marking the chosen cell with the player's color, and this new state persists into subsequent turns. A terminal condition is reached either when all cells are occupied or when a player successfully forms a line of exactly five consecutive pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The victory criteria grant a score of 100 to the player who forms such a line, while their opponent scores 0. If the board is completely filled without any player forming a line of five, the game ends in a draw, with both players receiving a score of 50. The game acknowledges potential bias towards the black player, but the rules remain impartial in terms of turn-based mechanics and winning conditions.
