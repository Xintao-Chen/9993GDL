The game is a variation of Tic-tac-toe played on a 5x5 grid, where two players, designated as xPlayer and oPlayer, take turns. The game begins with xPlayer in control. In each turn, the player in control can either place their respective mark ('x' or 'o') on an empty cell or do nothing, known as the noop action, if it is not their turn. The legality of a move depends on whether the cell is unoccupied. After each action, the game state updates to reflect the new mark on the grid, and control alternates between the players. The game imposes constraints, such as the boundaries of the 5x5 grid, ensuring players cannot mark outside these limits or on already occupied cells. The game concludes when a player forms a complete line of five consecutive marks in any row, column, or diagonal, or when no empty cells remain. Victory is determined based on these conditions: a player who completes a line of their marks wins, receiving a score of 100, while the opponent receives a score of 0. If the grid is full without any player completing a line, the game ends in a draw, granting both players a score of 50. If the game is ongoing and neither player has completed a line, the game is not yet terminal, and the score remains undetermined.
