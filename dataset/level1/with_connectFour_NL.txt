In the game of Connect Four, the environment is structured on a grid-based board employing a coordinate system where columns are labeled from 1 to 7 and rows from 1 to 6. Two players, designated as "red" and "black," alternately take turns, with the red player always starting first. The initial state of the game is determined by the player in control, which at the beginning is red. Turn control involves a mechanism known as "noop," where a player does nothing while the other player is in control, ensuring smooth alternation between players. Legal actions for each player consist of dropping a piece into one of the board's columns, but only if the column is open, meaning it is not full. The format of an action is specified as a drop into a specific column, such as (drop ?x), where ?x represents the column number. Upon executing a drop action, the game state changes as the piece occupies the lowest available cell in the specified column, with automatic events managing the alternate control of the game between players. Constraints within the game include the boundaries of the board, ensuring that pieces cannot be placed outside the designated columns and rows, and avoiding occupancy conflicts by only allowing pieces to be placed in open cells. The game concludes when a player forms a line of four consecutive pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when the board is completely filled, leaving no open columns. Scoring criteria dictate that if a player achieves a line of four, they score 100 points, and if neither player forms a line and the board is full, both players score 50 points. If the opposing player wins, the player in question scores zero. Throughout the game, the implicit constraints and rules ensure a fair and competitive environment, challenging players to strategically outmaneuver their opponent to achieve victory.
