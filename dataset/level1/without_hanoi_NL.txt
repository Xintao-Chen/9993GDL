The game is set in an environment consisting of three pillars, with a coordinate system that involves five discs, each of varying sizes, and three pillars named pillar1, pillar2, and pillar3. The player begins the game with a specific arrangement: disc5 is on pillar1, disc4 is on disc5, disc3 is on disc4, disc2 is on disc3, and disc1 is on disc2. The initial state also includes all discs and pillar2 and pillar3 being clear except for the smallest disc, disc1, and the game begins at step s0. There is only one player role who takes turns, and during each turn, the player can choose to perform a legal action or pass. Legal actions require that both the disc being moved and the target location are clear and that the disc being moved is smaller than the disc or pillar it is placed upon. The game progresses through a series of steps, with each step being a successor of the previous one. When a player moves a disc, it triggers a state change where the disc is placed on another disc or pillar, making the previous location clear. Implicit constraints include the boundaries of the board, where discs must always be placed on a larger disc or a pillar, ensuring no occupancy conflicts occur. The game reaches its terminal condition at step s31, which marks the end of the game. The player's goal is to build a tower on pillar3, with the height of the tower determining the score. If the player constructs a tower of height s5 on pillar3, they achieve the maximum score of 100. Towers of lesser heights on pillar3 result in lower scores, with specific scoring criteria for heights s4, s3, s2, and anything smaller than s2 resulting in a score of zero. The game is essentially a puzzle where the player must strategically move discs to achieve the highest possible score within the given time frame.
