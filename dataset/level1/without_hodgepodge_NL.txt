The game, set in a cyclical environment composed of locations a, b, c, and d, features two players: white and black, who alternate turns in the game. Initially, the board is configured with location b and c clear, a is occupied by c, and both a and b are designated as tables, with a step counter set to 1. The game allows white to perform actions of type s and u, while black can execute move, grab, and drop actions. White's actions are legal if the source and destination are distinct and meet certain occupancy conditions, such as the source being clear and designated as a table. Black's moves are unrestricted in legality, but grabbing requires the presence of gold at the cell, and dropping is contingent on holding gold. Actions lead to various state changes: white's actions can move objects between locations, modifying table and clear states, while black's actions can relocate gold between cells, specifically affecting the gold's position and state of occupancy. Implicit constraints include adjacency between the locations, which restrict movements to neighboring cells, and occupancy conflicts that prevent stacking on an already occupied location unless it's specified as a table and clear. The game reaches a terminal condition either after the second step or when white successfully places objects on a and b, b and c, and black places gold on a. Scoring for white is pegged at 100 points if their objects are correctly stacked in sequence on a, b, and c, while black scores 100 if they manage to place gold on a, with any deviation from these goals resulting in zero points.
