The game is set within a linear environment consisting of eight cells, each initially containing one coin. The sole player, referred to as "you," takes turns to execute their moves in a predetermined order. The game begins with all cells populated by one coin and the step initialized at one. Turn control is managed through the ability to perform a "jump" action, which is legal only if both the starting cell and the target cell contain a coin, and there is a valid "two between" relationship between these cells. This means that there must be an intermediary relationship allowing the jump, defined by specific conditions on the number of coins in between. If a jump is executed from cell x to cell y, cell x becomes empty while cell y ends up with two coins. The state transitions automatically as a result of these actions, updating the number of coins in the involved cells and incrementing the step counter. Implicit constraints include the linear order of cells, ensuring jumps respect the board boundaries, and preventing occupancy conflicts by maintaining distinct cells during actions. The game reaches a terminal state when no legal moves are available. To win, the player must reach step five, which yields a score of 100, while the presence of any cell retaining its initial state of one coin results in a score of zero. The victory criteria emphasize the player's strategic ability to manage coin distribution efficiently across the board within the given constraints.
