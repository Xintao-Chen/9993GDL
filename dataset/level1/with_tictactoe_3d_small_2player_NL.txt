The game of 3D Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a 3x3x3 grid where two players, referred to as xplayer and oplayer, take turns in a specific order, starting with xplayer. The initial state of the game has all cells on the grid empty, represented by the state 'b', and control is given to xplayer. The coordinate system for the grid is defined, allowing values from 1 to 3 for each dimension, creating a cubic playing field. Players alternate turns, and during their turn, the player with control can select an empty cell to place their mark, which is either 'x' for xplayer or 'o' for oplayer. The game enforces implicit constraints such as board boundaries, ensuring that selections are within the defined coordinates, and it prevents occupancy conflicts by allowing selections only on empty cells. The game progresses as players place their marks, with the turn control automatically switching to the next player after each selection. If a player cannot make a move, they can perform a 'noop' action, effectively passing their turn. A player achieves victory by forming a line of three of their marks in any of the 13 possible directions, which include straight lines along any axis, diagonals, and cross-diagonals within the 3D space. The game can also end when the board is completely filled without any player forming a line, resulting in a draw. The scoring is straightforward: a player scores 100 points for winning by forming a line, 50 points if the game ends in a draw with no lines formed by either player, and 0 points if the opponent forms a line and wins. The game reaches a terminal state either when a line is formed or when there are no open cells left to play.
