In the Queens Puzzle game, the objective is to place queens on an NxN chessboard in such a way that none of them can attack each other. This setup excludes the possibility of solving the puzzle on 2x2 or 3x3 boards. The game is played by a single player, referred to as "robot," who takes turns placing each queen on the board. The game begins with all cells on the board being empty, and the player is tasked with placing the first queen. During each turn, the player places a queen on any cell that is currently blank, following the rule that a move is only legal if the cell is unoccupied. Once a queen is placed, the cell's state changes from blank to occupied by a queen, while other cells remain unchanged. The game continues until there are no more queens left to place, which marks the end of the game. Implicit constraints include board boundaries and ensuring that no two queens can attack each other, meaning they cannot share the same row, column, or diagonal. The game's scoring system awards a score of 0 if any queen is under attack and 100 if all queens are placed without threat. The logic determining whether a cell is attacked checks for the presence of queens in the same row, column, or diagonals defined by consistent sums or differences of row and column indices. The puzzle's constraints are defined by a successor relation, which determines the sequence of numbers relevant to the board's size and extends beyond the board's boundaries to facilitate calculations involving diagonal attacks. The challenge is to strategically place each queen to achieve the maximum score by ensuring all are safe from attack.
