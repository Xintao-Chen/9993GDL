In the game environment, a single player role known as the robot operates within a predefined coordinate system. The game begins in an initial state labeled as s1. The robot takes actions sequentially in any of the states, with specific actions labeled from a to g. Initially, from state s1, actions a through f are legal, while action g becomes legal when the game reaches state s7. The noop mechanism ensures that actions are controlled and only those meeting the conditions of the current state are permissible. Each action taken by the robot leads to a state transition: for instance, action a moves the game to state s2, action b to s3, and so forth, up until action g which transitions the game from state s7 to s8. Implicit constraints such as board boundaries are not directly specified, but the progression of states suggests a linear path that must be followed. The game concludes when it reaches terminal states, which include s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, and s8. Scoring is straightforward; the robot achieves victory with a score of 100 if it reaches state s8, but scores 0 if it fails to reach this terminal state. The gameâ€™s structure suggests a focus on strategic action selection to navigate through states successfully, culminating in the desired end state for maximum points.
