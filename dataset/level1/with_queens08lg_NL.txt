In the Queens Puzzle game, the environment consists of an NxN board with a coordinate system where each cell can either be blank or occupied by a queen. The game is played by a single player, referred to as the "robot," who takes turns placing queens on the board. The initial state of the game finds all cells blank with the player set to place the first queen. Each turn involves placing a queen on a cell, and the player has the option to quit the game at any time. The player can place a queen in any blank cell, provided the cell is not under attack by another queen, which means no other queen resides in the same row, column, or diagonal. The player can also choose to quit, which becomes the sole legal move if a mistake in placement occurs. When a queen is placed, the cell's state changes to occupied, and the next queen placement is prepared. If the player decides to quit, the game state is marked as finished. The game concludes when the player has no more queens to place or opts to quit. If the player quits, they receive a score of 0, but if they successfully place all queens without quitting, they score 100. Implicit constraints include the board boundaries, ensuring queens do not attack each other, and avoiding occupancy conflicts. The game uses a successor relation for coordinates, extending up to twice the board size and down to negative values to support diagonal checks. The game is designed such that players can place queens on any board size, except for 2x2 and 3x3, where it's not possible to place the queens without them attacking each other.
