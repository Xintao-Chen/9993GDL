The game "Buttons and Lights" involves a single player role, the robot, which operates within a simple environment where three lights, labeled p, q, and r, can be either on or off. The coordinate system of the game is not spatial but rather based on the states of these lights. The game begins with all lights off and a step counter starting at 1. The robot takes turns, with the opportunity to perform one of three possible actions: a, b, or c. Each action is always legal for the robot to execute, and they trigger specific state changes. Action a toggles the state of light p and turns q and r on if they were initially off, or turns them off if they were on. Action b swaps the states of lights p and q while leaving r unchanged. Action c maintains the state of p and swaps the states of q and r. The game progresses by incrementing the step count in each turn, following a predefined sequence of seven steps. There are no board boundaries or spatial constraints, but the game enforces implicit constraints through occupancy conflicts, as each light can only be either on or off at any time. The game reaches a terminal state either when the step counter reaches 7 or when all three lights are on simultaneously. The victory condition for the robot is achieved by having all three lights on, at which point the robot scores 100 points. If any of the lights are not on at the end of the game, the robot scores 0 points.
