The game is played on a 3x3 grid, with each cell initially set to 'b', indicating it is blank. Two players take turns, with roles designated as "odd" and "even." The player with the role "odd" starts the game, controlling the grid initially. Players alternate turns throughout the game. The game involves marking the grid cells with numbers corresponding to the player's role, with "odd" marking odd numbers and "even" marking even numbers. A player can only mark a cell if it is blank and if they control the turn. The action to mark a cell is represented as (mark ?m ?n ?x), where ?m and ?n are the coordinates, and ?x is the player's number. The game also includes a "noop" action, which allows a player to pass their turn if no legal moves are available. State changes occur when a player marks a cell, with the control of the game switching to the other player after each turn. Implicit constraints include ensuring that numbers are placed in blank cells and that players can only use their allocated numbers. The game ends when a "line" is formed, which can be a row, column, or diagonal where the sum of the numbers matches certain predefined conditions, or when there are no open cells left on the grid. The victory condition is met when a player forms a line out of turn, scoring 100 points. If no line is formed and the grid is full, both players score 50 points. If a player forms a line on their turn, they score 0 points. The game reaches a terminal state when a line is formed or when there are no more blank cells available.
