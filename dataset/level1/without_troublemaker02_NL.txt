The game, called "troublemaker02," is played by a single player who assumes the role of "player." The environment is structured around two distinct coordinate graphs: the first graph connects points a, b1, b2, and c, while the second graph links points x, y1, y2, and z. The game's initial state positions the player at point a on the first graph and at point x on the second graph. The player takes turns to make moves, with the option to perform either a "move1" or "move2" action, depending on their current position. For a "move1" action to be legal, the player must be at a position on the first graph with a direct connection to the desired destination. Similarly, a "move2" action is legal if the player is at a position on the second graph that directly connects to the intended next point. When a player executes a move, the game's state updates to reflect the player's new position on the respective graph. The game's implicit constraints include ensuring moves are confined within the boundaries of the respective graphs and maintaining the connectivity rules between positions. The game reaches a terminal state under several conditions: when the player is at positions c on the first graph and z on the second, or various combinations of positions such as a at pos1 and z at pos2, or c and x, or b1 and y1. Achieving the terminal condition where the player reaches c on the first graph and z on the second yields the maximum score of 100 points, signifying victory. Any other terminal condition results in a score of 0, indicating failure to meet the victory criteria. The game also incorporates a noop mechanism, where no action is taken if the player cannot make a legal move, ensuring the game only progresses through valid actions.
