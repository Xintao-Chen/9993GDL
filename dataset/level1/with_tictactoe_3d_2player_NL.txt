In the game of 3D-Tictactoe, two players, designated as xplayer and oplayer, engage in a strategic battle on a four-by-four-by-four cubic grid. The game begins with all cells in the grid marked as empty, denoted by 'b', and the xplayer having initial control of the first move. Players alternate turns, with xplayer followed by oplayer, as outlined by the nextplayer function. Each player can either perform a noop action if it is not their turn or select an empty cell on their turn, marking it with their respective symbol, 'x' for xplayer and 'o' for oplayer. A selection is considered legal if the cell is empty and it is the player's turn. Actions directly result in the change of a cell's state and transfer control to the other player. The game implicitly enforces boundaries within the 4x4x4 cube and prevents occupancy conflicts by ensuring a cell can only be marked if it is empty. The game reaches a terminal state when either player forms a line of four of their symbols in any of the 13 possible directions through the cube, or when all cells are filled without a winning line, indicating a draw. Victory is determined by achieving a line, where the successful player earns a perfect score of 100, while the opponent receives a score of 0. If no lines are formed by the end of the game, both players receive a score of 50, reflecting a draw.
