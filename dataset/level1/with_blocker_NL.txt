The game is set on a grid defined by a coordinate system with indices ranging from 1 to 4 for both the x and y axes, forming a 4x4 board. There are two players, each assuming a distinct role: the "crosser" and the "blocker". The turns are structured such that both players alternate in taking actions. Initially, every cell on the board is marked as empty, denoted by 'b'. During their turn, each player can choose to take a specific action, which involves marking a cell. The crosser aims to mark a sequence of connected cells across the board from the first column to the fourth, while the blocker aims to prevent this. The noop mechanism is in place, meaning that if a player cannot make a legal move, they effectively do nothing that turn. An action is formatted as the player marking a specific cell, and for it to be legal, the targeted cell must be empty and the player must be eligible to make a move. When a crosser marks a cell, it becomes a crosser cell, unless the blocker has already marked it. Conversely, a blocker can only mark an empty cell. The board maintains implicit constraints such as boundary limits of the grid, preventing any moves outside the 1 to 4 index range, and ensures no cell can be occupied by both players simultaneously. The game reaches a terminal state if the crosser successfully creates a continuous path from the left to the right of the board, or if there are no empty cells remaining. In terms of scoring, if the crosser creates a path, they score 100 points and the blocker scores 0. If the game ends without a path and no empty cells are left, the blocker scores 100 points and the crosser scores 0. The game concludes when one of these terminal conditions is met, determining the winner based on their respective roles and objectives.
