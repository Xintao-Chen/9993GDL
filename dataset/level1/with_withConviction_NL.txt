The game is played on a 5x5 grid, with rows and columns indexed from 1 to 5. There are two players, designated as red and blue, who take turns marking the grid. The game begins with red in control. Each player can either mark a cell with a shade (weak, medium, or strong) or perform a noop action if they are not in control. A player can legally mark a cell if they are in control, the cell is empty, and the shade is not prohibited for them. A cell is considered filled once marked. After a player makes a move, the control switches to the other player. If a player uses a weak shade, they face restrictions on using medium or strong shades in subsequent turns. The game has boundaries, and players cannot mark filled cells or use prohibited shades. The game becomes terminal if a player completes a line in a row or column with consistent shading and without any opponent's marks or empty cells, or if there are no open spaces left for a player. Victory is determined by scoring: a player scores 100 points if they complete a line, 50 points if neither player completes a line by the end of available moves, and 0 if the opponent completes a line.
