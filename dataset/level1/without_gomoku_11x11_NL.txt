In the game of Gomoku played on an 11x11 board, the environment is defined by a grid with coordinates ranging from 1 to 11 in both the x and y directions. The players in this game are assigned the roles of black and white, with black always making the first move. The initial state of the game assigns control to the black player. Players alternate turns, and when it's not a player's turn, they can legally perform a 'noop' action, meaning they do nothing. On a player's turn, they can place a piece on any empty cell, defined as a cell that is indexed but not occupied by a piece. Once a player places their piece on an empty cell, the action results in a state change where the cell becomes occupied by that player's color. The game automatically switches control to the other player after a move. The game is bound by implicit constraints such as board boundaries, ensuring that pieces cannot be placed outside the 11x11 grid, and occupancy conflicts, which prevent placing a piece on an already occupied cell. The game reaches a terminal state when there are no empty cells left on the board or when a player successfully forms a line of exactly five consecutive pieces, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If a player achieves this, they are awarded a score of 100, while their opponent receives 0. If the board is filled without any player forming such a line, the game is a draw, and both players receive a score of 50. The game's rules ensure that lines of more than five do not result in a win, aligning with the standard Gomoku rules, despite the acknowledged bias towards the black player.
