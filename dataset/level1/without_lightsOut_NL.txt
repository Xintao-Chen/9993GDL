The game is set on a grid with a coordinate system ranging from 1 to 5 in both dimensions, forming a 5x5 board. Each cell in this grid can be in one of two states: "light" or "nolight." Initially, the board is set up such that certain cells are lit and others are not, as specified in the initial configuration. The game involves a single player who takes turns to switch the state of the cells. During each turn, the player can perform a "switch" action on a cell at coordinates (x, y) as long as those coordinates are valid, meaning they fall within the 1 to 5 range. This switch action is legal if it targets any cell on the board. Performing a switch affects not only the targeted cell but also its adjacent ones, flipping their states from light to nolight or vice versa. The game progresses through a sequence of steps, starting from step 0, with each step representing a turn. The player may choose to perform an action or opt for a "noop" (no operation), effectively passing their turn. The game concludes under two terminal conditions: either when the game reaches step 20 or when there are no cells in the "light" state, known as the "lighton" condition. The victory condition is based on whether the board has any lights on; if there are no lights on, the player scores 100 points, indicating a win, otherwise, they score 0 points. The game mechanics implicitly enforce several constraints, such as board boundaries, meaning actions are only applicable within the defined grid, and the effects of an action are limited by adjacency, affecting only neighboring cells. The player's objective is to strategically switch the cells to achieve the desired end state within the given number of steps.
