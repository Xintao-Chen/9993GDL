The game is played on an 8x7 grid, representing a field of chocolates, where two players, designated as player1 and player2, take turns. The grid is initialized with chocolates occupying every cell, from positions (1,1) through (8,7). Player1 takes the first turn, as indicated by the initial control state. On their turn, each player can perform a "bite" action, choosing to bite a piece of chocolate located at coordinates (x, y) if they are in control and the chocolate is present at that position. Alternatively, the player can perform a noop action when it is the other playerâ€™s turn. Once a player bites into the chocolate at position (1,1), they become "poisoned," which is a key aspect of the game's progression and outcome. After a player bites, the control switches to the other player, continuing the alternating turn sequence. The bite action removes all chocolates located at or to the right and below the bitten piece, maintaining the integrity of the chocolate grid. The grid maintains its initial state unless modified by a bite action, which enforces the constraints that limit actions to chocolates within the grid and prevent occupancy conflicts. The game ends once a player is poisoned, resulting in terminal conditions. The player who avoids biting the poisoned chocolate at (1,1) wins, achieving a goal score of 100, while the poisoned player receives a score of 0. If neither player bites the poisoned chocolate, both receive a score of 0, ensuring that the player who forces their opponent to bite the poisoned piece secures victory. The game's coordinate and number system, defined by the 'number' and 'succ' relations, establishes the order and boundaries of positions and comparisons within the grid.
