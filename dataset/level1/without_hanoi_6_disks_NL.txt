The game is set in an environment that involves three pillars and six discs, with the coordinate system defined by the stacking relationships among these discs and pillars. The player, who is the sole participant, takes turns to make moves. Initially, the discs are stacked in ascending order on pillar1, with disc6 at the bottom and disc1 at the top, and pillars 2 and 3 are empty. The game begins at step 1, with the player having the option to either "give up" or execute a "puton" action, where a disc can be placed on another disc or pillar, provided both the moving disc and the target are clear, and the disc being placed is smaller than the one it is placed upon. The game's turn control advances automatically with each valid move, and players can pass their turn with a noop action, though this is not explicitly mentioned. Each action must adhere to the legality conditions, which include ensuring the target location is clear and observing the size hierarchy of discs. State changes occur after each action, updating the positions of discs and the status of whether a disc or pillar is clear. Implicit constraints include ensuring actions respect the boundaries of the board by not allowing moves that place a larger disc on a smaller one or a disc where it cannot physically be due to the game's rules. The game concludes when either the player successfully builds a tower of all six discs on pillar3, the player gives up, or 64 steps have been completed. Victory is achieved by constructing a tower on pillar3, resulting in a score of 100 for the player, whereas giving up results in a score of 5, and failing to build the tower within the given turns without giving up results in a score of 0.
