The game is played on a 12x12 board with coordinates ranging from (0,0) to (11,11), where the outermost rows and columns form "walls," restricting the playable area to coordinates between (1,1) and (10,10). The game features two players, red and blue, who take turns moving. Initially, red starts at position (3,3) while blue starts at (8,8). Each player can move in four possible directions: up, down, left, or right. These moves are always legal as long as they stay within the boundaries of the board and do not conflict with occupied spaces. When a player moves, the cell they vacate remains marked as visited, and their new position becomes an occupied cell. If a player moves onto a cell that has already been visited, or if both players occupy the same cell, the game reaches a terminal state. The scoring system awards 100 points to a player if their opponent hits a wall, while they themselves do not. Conversely, 0 points are given to a player if they hit a wall but their opponent does not. If both players hit a wall simultaneously or collide with each other, each receives 50 points. The game concludes when one of these terminal conditions is met, determining the winner based on the scoring criteria.
