The game is set in an environment with a simple coordinate system where numbers from 1 to 63 represent possible guesses. There are two player roles: the "guesser" and the "chooser," with the guesser starting the game. Initially, the game begins at step 1, and the guesser is in control with all numbers from 1 to 63 being possible guesses. The guesser makes a guess by choosing a number from the possible set, and the chooser responds with either "higher," "lower," or "wait," depending on whether the guessed number is less than, greater than, or equal to the number they have in mind. If the guesser guesses the correct number, the game ends. The guesser's legal actions depend on the current control, allowing them to guess when in control or wait otherwise. The chooser's legal responses are contingent on the guess and the possible number, with "higher" and "lower" being options if the guessed number is incorrect. The game progresses by alternating control between the guesser and chooser after each action. Actions trigger state changes, such as updating which numbers remain possible, depending on whether the chooser indicates "higher" or "lower." Implicit constraints include maintaining the set of possible numbers, which is narrowed down based on the chooser's feedback, and ensuring numbers guessed are within the defined boundaries. The game becomes terminal when either the guesser correctly guesses the number or when step 12 is reached without a correct guess. Scoring is straightforward: if the game ends with a correct guess, the guesser scores 100 points and the chooser scores 0; if not, the chooser scores 100 points and the guesser scores 0. The game is designed to terminate either upon successful guessing or after a maximum of 12 steps, ensuring a finite and competitive structure where strategic narrowing down of possibilities is key to success.
