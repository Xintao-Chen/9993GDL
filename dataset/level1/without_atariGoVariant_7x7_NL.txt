Atari Go is a simplified variant of the traditional game of Go, with a primary objective for the first player to capture an opponent's stone to win. The game environment is played on a 7x7 grid, where each intersection can be occupied by a stone or remain empty. The coordinate system uses indices ranging from 1 to 7 for both rows and columns. Players assume the roles of "black" and "white," with black taking the first turn, as indicated by the initial control. Turns alternate between the two players, with the player in control required to make a move by placing a stone on an empty intersection. Passing is not allowed, which means each player must play a stone during their turn. Legal actions involve specifying the coordinates where the player wishes to place their stone, with the condition that the chosen spot is empty. The game tracks the occupation of cells and automatically updates the state to reflect the newly placed stones and the change of control to the opposite player. Implicit constraints include boundaries of the board, ensuring moves are made within the 7x7 grid, and adjacency rules, which are crucial for determining liberties and capturing conditions. A player's move can result in a win if it surrounds an opponent's stones without liberties, and conversely, a player loses if their own stones are surrounded without capturing any of the opponent's pieces. The game reaches a terminal state when any player's stone is without liberties, triggering the end of the game. Scoring is straightforward; the player who successfully captures an opponent's stone first is awarded a winning score of 100, while the losing player receives a score of 0. If no winner emerges, both players are assigned a neutral score of 50.
