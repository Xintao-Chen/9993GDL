The game "Connect Four - Win by losing" is set on a grid with a coordinate system that includes columns labeled 1 to 8 and rows labeled 1 to 6. There are two player roles, red and black, who take turns to play, with red starting first. Initially, the game is set with the control given to red. Players can perform one of two actions during their turn: they can either drop a piece into a column or choose to do nothing by executing a "noop" action. The legality of an action is determined by turn control and whether the chosen column is open for a new piece. A column is considered open if its topmost row is unoccupied. The game enforces implicit constraints such as ensuring moves occur within the board boundaries and preventing players from dropping pieces in full columns. During a player's turn, if they drop a piece into a column, it falls to the lowest available row in that column. The control then switches to the other player, continuing the turn-taking sequence. The game ends when a player forms a line of four of their pieces either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when there are no open columns left. In terms of scoring, a player wins the game by forcing the opponent to create a line of four, scoring 100 points, while a player who creates a line themselves scores 0 points. If neither player forms a line and the board is full, both players score 50 points, but if the board is not yet full and neither has formed a line, the game continues without scoring. The unique twist in this game is that players aim to lose by making the opponent win, thereby securing the highest score themselves.
