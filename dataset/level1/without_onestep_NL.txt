The game is set in a simple environment where two players, identified as the roles "white" and "black," take turns to play. The game begins in the initial state labeled as "o1." In this game, each player has a choice of two actions: "a" and "b." The player "white" takes the first turn, followed by "black," and they continue to alternate in this manner. To pass a turn, a player can perform a "noop," which means no operation. The actions a player can choose are subject to legality; both players can legally perform actions "a" and "b" during their respective turns. When "white" performs action "a" in state "o1," the game transitions to state "o2." If "white" performs action "b" in state "o1," the game transitions to state "o3." The game includes implicit constraints such as board boundaries, but these are not explicitly detailed in the game's rules. The game reaches a terminal condition once it transitions to either state "o2" or "o3," at which point the game ends. Scoring is determined by the state the game ends in: if the game ends in state "o2," the goal value for "white" is 10 points and 90 for "black." Conversely, if the game ends in state "o3," "white" scores 90 points and "black" scores 10 points. If the game remains in the initial state "o1," both players receive 0 points. The player with the higher score at the game's conclusion is declared the winner.
