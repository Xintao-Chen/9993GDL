; Atari Go
;
; GDL by Alex Landau
;
; This is a Go variant in which the first player to make a capture
; wins the game.
;
; In this version, the active player is not allowed to pass.
;
; This differs from atariGo_7x7 in that groups are not tracked as part
; of the state and instead liberties are computed recursively. This
; makes the game state more compact, but is much more difficult for
; many engines to compute.
