The game is set in a simple environment represented by a 2x2 grid with a coordinate system where positions are defined by (cell x y z), with x and y indicating the cell's location on the grid and z representing the cell's state, ranging from 0 to 4. The player assumes the role of a robot, which is the only active participant in the game, and takes actions in a sequential order. The game begins with all cells initialized to a state of 0, and the round counter set to 0. Each turn, the robot can perform a "press" action at coordinates (x, y) within the bounds of the grid, where both x and y can only be 1 or 2. A noop mechanism is implied by the ability of the game to progress without any action if no legal moves are made. Each action taken by the robot increases the state of the targeted cell to 4, with all non-targeted cells decrementing by one state, or remaining at 0 if they are already at the lowest state. The game has implicit constraints such as board boundaries, ensuring actions are confined within the 2x2 grid and that occupancy conflicts are managed by the state system. The game ends when all cells reach a non-zero state simultaneously, indicated by the lightson condition, or when the third round is completed. The robot achieves a perfect score of 100 if it successfully lights up all cells by the third round or if it simply reaches the third round under any conditions, satisfying the win criteria.
