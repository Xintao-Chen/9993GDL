In this game, the environment is set on a grid with coordinates ranging from 1 to 2 on the x-axis and 1 to 10 on the y-axis. The player takes on the role of a robot and is the sole participant, executing actions in a sequential manner without any competition from other players. Initially, all cells in the grid are set to a value of 0, and the game begins with a counter initialized at 1. The player can choose to perform a "press" action on any grid cell with coordinates that fall within the defined x and y ranges. The legality of an action is determined by the cell coordinates being within these specified bounds. When the robot presses a cell, the state of that cell changes to 4 in the next turn. This triggers a cascading effect where cells decrement their values each turn, transitioning from 4 to 3, 3 to 2, 2 to 1, and 1 back to 0, while cells already at 0 remain unchanged. The counter increments with each action, and as the game progresses, certain conditions can trigger the "lightson" states, which are dependent on specific patterns of activated cells. The game reaches a terminal state when either the "lightson" state reaches 9 or the counter hits 21, signifying the end of the game. To achieve victory, the player must successfully activate a "lightson" state of 9, which grants a score of 100, while failing to do so results in a score of 0. Implicit constraints include the boundaries of the grid, ensuring actions are only performed within the designated coordinate system, and the mechanical occupancy conflicts that prevent multiple actions on a single cell in one turn.
