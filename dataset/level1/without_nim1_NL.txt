The game is set in an environment with a coordinate system involving four heaps labeled a, b, c, and d. Each heap initially contains a specified number of items: heap a with 1, heap b with 5, heap c with 4, and heap d with 2. Two players, player1 and player2, participate in this game, taking turns in alternating order, with player1 starting first. The control of turns is managed by a mechanism that allows only the player in control to make a move, while the other player can only perform a 'noop' action, which effectively means doing nothing. The primary action available to a player is to reduce the number of items in a chosen heap by a certain amount, provided the amount is smaller than the current number of items in that heap. When a player performs a 'reduce' action, the heap's state updates to reflect the new number of items, and control is passed to the other player. The game imposes implicit constraints such as ensuring no heap can have a negative number of items and preventing occupancy conflicts by allowing only one player to act at a time. The game reaches its terminal state when all heaps are empty, signaling the end of the game. Scoring is determined based on control; a player who ends their turn with control receives 0 points, while the other player, who is next in line to play, is awarded 100 points, effectively making them the winner. The game's logic ensures a clear winner once all heaps are depleted, with players striving to force their opponent to be the one in control at the game's conclusion.
