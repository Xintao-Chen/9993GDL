The 8-puzzle game is set within a 3x3 grid environment, where the coordinates are defined by a row and column system ranging from 1 to 3. In this single-player game, the player takes on the role of arranging numbered tiles, numbered 1 through 8, along with a blank tile denoted as 'b'. The game begins with the tiles initially arranged in a specific order: the top row contains tiles 8, 7, and 6, the middle row has tiles 5, 4, and 3, and the bottom row houses tiles 2, 1, with the blank tile in position (3,3). The player controls the game by attempting to move the blank tile into an adjacent position, which is only legal if the intended move involves a tile that is directly next to the blank tile horizontally or vertically. The blank tileâ€™s movement is constrained by the boundaries of the board and the adjacency defined by the successor and predecessor relationships, ensuring that only valid moves can occur. When a player makes a move, the game state updates automatically, swapping the positions of the blank tile with the adjacent numbered tile. The game tracks the number of steps taken, incrementing with each move, to a maximum of 60 steps. The game reaches a terminal state when either the tiles are arranged in order from 1 to 8 with the blank in the last position, or when 60 moves have been made. Scoring is determined by the arrangement of the tiles: if the tiles are in order by step 30, the player scores 100 points; if in order after step 30, they score 99 points; and if the tiles are not in order by the end of the game, the score is 0. The player wins by achieving a score of 100 or 99, indicating a successful arrangement of the puzzle within the allowed steps.
