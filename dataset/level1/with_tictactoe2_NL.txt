The Tic-tac-toe game is structured on a 3x3 grid, using a simple coordinate system with indices ranging from 1 to 3 for both rows and columns. There are two players, referred to as xPlayer and oPlayer, who alternate turns throughout the game. Initially, the xPlayer is in control and begins the game. Players can either make a move by placing their respective marks ('x' or 'o') on an empty cell or choose to 'noop', which effectively passes the turn. The 'noop' action is only legal when it is the other player's turn. A move is deemed legal if the cell at the specified coordinates is unoccupied. Each action, when executed, results in the marking of the grid and the transfer of control to the other player. Implicit constraints include the boundaries of the grid, ensuring that players can only mark within the 3x3 board, and that they cannot place a mark on an already occupied cell. The game reaches a terminal state if a player completes a line of three of their marks, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or if there are no open spaces left on the board. If a player forms a line, they win, scoring 100 points. If the board is full with no lines formed, it results in a draw, and both players score 50 points. Conversely, if one player forms a line, the opposing player scores 0. The game is primarily driven by the pursuit of creating lines and managing board occupancy strategically.
