The game "Catch a Mouse" is set on a grid-like board with specific coordinates, consisting of rows and columns, where the rows are numbered from 1 to 9 and the columns from 1 to h. Each player assumes one of two roles: the mouse or the catcher, and the game begins with the catcher in control. The board's initial state is mostly empty, with specific cells designated as holes or traps. The mouse starts on cell (7, 1), while the catcher's role involves placing traps. Players alternate turns, and only the player currently in control can take action, while the other must perform a 'noop' (no operation). Legal actions for the catcher involve laying a trap on an empty cell, while the mouse can move to an adjacent connected cell, whether horizontally or vertically. State changes occur based on player actions; for example, when the mouse moves, it occupies a new cell, leaving the old one empty. The game automatically switches control between players after each action. Implicit constraints include board boundaries and occupancy conflicts, meaning a player cannot perform actions that result in leaving the board or occupying a non-empty cell. The game ends when the mouse is caught in a trap, escapes through a hole, or after 20 turns. Victory is determined by whether the mouse escapes or is caught; if the mouse escapes, it wins and scores 100 points, while the catcher scores 0. Conversely, if the mouse is caught, the catcher wins and scores 100 points while the mouse scores 0.
