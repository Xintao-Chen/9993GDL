In this game, players assume the roles of either 'white' or 'black' and take turns in a structured sequence beginning with the player designated as 'white'. The game starts with numbers 1 through 9 available for selection, and control initially assigned to 'white'. Players take turns selecting numbers, with the action 'take' being the primary move, where a player can take any available number. The legality of a move is contingent upon the number being available and the player having control; otherwise, a 'noop' action is applied, where a player effectively passes their turn. The state changes dynamically as numbers are taken; once a number is taken by a player, it is no longer available, and control of the turn switches to the other player. Implicit constraints within the game include the availability of numbers and the control of turn order, with no two players selecting the same number. The game concludes when either a player achieves a 'sum15' condition, where they possess a combination of three numbers that sum to 15, or when no numbers are left available. In terms of scoring and victory conditions, a player wins outright with a score of 100 if they achieve the 'sum15' condition. If neither player achieves this condition and all numbers are taken, the game is a draw, awarding each player a score of 50. If one player achieves a 'sum15', the other player scores 0. The game thus revolves around strategic number selection and blocking the opponent from completing a winning sum.
