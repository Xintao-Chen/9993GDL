In the game "Pearls," there is a single player role known as the robot, which operates within a linear coordinate system. The game begins in the initial state of p1, and the player, referred to as the robot, takes sequential turns. During a turn, the player can choose one of three possible actions: a, b, or c, depending on the current state. The noop mechanism, which implies doing nothing, is not explicitly present but can be inferred as an illegal move unless the robot is in a state where no actions are available. The format of each action is simple, where the robot selects an action that is deemed legal based on the current state. For instance, the robot can perform action a when in states p1, p2, p5, p6, p9, p10, p13, or p14, action b when in states p1, p3, p5, p7, p9, p11, p13, or p15, and action c when in states p4, p8, or p12. Once an action is executed, it triggers a state change, advancing the game to the next sequential state, such as moving from p1 to p2 when executing action a. The board boundaries are implicitly defined by the sequence of states from p1 to p16, with state p16 acting as the terminal condition. The game concludes when the robot reaches state p16, at which point the robot scores 90 points, signifying victory. If the game ends without reaching p16, the robot scores 0 points, indicating a loss. There are no distance relationships or occupancy conflicts as the game progresses in a straightforward linear fashion, with each state allowing specific actions that lead to the next state in the sequence.
