In the Blocks World game, the environment consists of a set of blocks and a table, with the game utilizing a coordinate system based on the position of these blocks. The sole player in the game is the robot, who takes turns manipulating the blocks. The game begins with block c on block a, both of which are on the table, and block b is clear. The robot player is responsible for controlling the turns, and the game progresses through a series of steps, starting at step one. The robot can perform two types of actions: stacking one block onto another or unstacking a block from another block. These actions are only legal if the blocks involved satisfy certain conditions, such as the block to be moved being clear and distinct from the destination block. When the robot executes an action, the game state changes automatically, reflecting the new positions of the blocks and updating which blocks are clear. Implicit constraints include ensuring that actions respect board boundaries and avoid conflicts, such as placing a block where another is already present. The game can end in two ways: either when step four is reached or when block a is on block b and block b is on block c. The robot wins if it successfully stacks block a on block b and block b on block c, achieving a goal score of 100. If these conditions are not met, the robot scores zero, indicating a loss.
