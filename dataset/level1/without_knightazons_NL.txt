The game is set on a 10x10 grid-based environment where two players, designated as white and black, take turns to play. At the beginning of the game, white controls the pieces located at coordinates (4, 1), (7, 1), (1, 4), and (10, 4), while black controls the pieces at (1, 7), (10, 7), (4, 10), and (7, 10). The player in control alternates each turn, with white initially holding control, and each player can choose to perform an action or a noop (no operation) if it is not their turn. Each action involves a player moving a piece from its current position to a new location following a knight's move pattern from chess, and optionally shooting an arrow to a second new location, which must also be empty. The legal conditions for actions require that the initial move lands on an empty cell, and any subsequent arrow shot must also land on an empty cell. The grid imposes boundaries, and conflicts arise if a cell is occupied by a player or an arrow, preventing further occupancy. The game reaches a terminal state when one player can no longer make a legal move, resulting in the opposing player achieving victory with a score of 100, while the player unable to move scores zero. This setup implies that players must strategically position their pieces and arrows to block their opponent's potential moves, utilizing the constraints of knight movement and empty cell requirements to their advantage.
