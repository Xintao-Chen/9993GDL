The game, a variant of Tic-Tac-Toe, is played on two separate boards labeled board1 and board2. It involves two players, xplayer and oplayer, who alternate turns. Initially, all positions on both boards are blank, and control of board1 is with xplayer while oplayer controls board2. Players take turns marking a blank position on the board they control. If no move can be made, players can perform a noop action, essentially passing their turn. A mark action is only legal if the position is blank, the player controls the board, and no line has been formed on the board yet. The game automatically updates states: if a player marks a position, the position becomes theirs, and control alternates to the other player. Implicit constraints include the board boundaries, meaning players can only mark within the nine positions labeled a through i. The game ends when there is a winning line on both boards, a winning line on one board while the other is full, or both boards are full without any winning lines. Scoring is based on the presence of winning linesâ€”xplayer scores 100 points if both boards have a winning line of 'X's, 75 if one board has a line of 'X's and the other does not have any line, 25 if one board has a line of 'O's without a line on the other board, and 0 if both boards have winning lines of 'O's. Oplayer's scoring is similar: 100 points for 'O' lines on both boards, 75 if one board has a line of 'O's and the other has no line, 25 if one board has a line of 'X's without a line on the other board, and 0 if both boards have winning lines of 'X's. The game is also terminal if a board has a winning line and the other board is full or no more moves can be made on either board.
