In the game "LightsOn," played within a 4x4 grid environment, a single player takes on the role of a robot, navigating through a coordinate system where each cell is initially set to zero, representing an unlit state. The game begins with all cells unlit and the step count at zero. The robot's task is to light up cells across four distinct 2x2 regions within this grid, and it takes turns by executing the “press” action. This action is legal when pressing occurs within specified indices: x1 and y1 must be 1 or 2, while x2 and y2, as well as x3 and y3, must be 3 or 4. The robot can press up to four cells simultaneously, and each press changes the state of the affected cells to 4, indicating they are fully lit. Subsequently, these cells will gradually reduce in value each turn, simulating lights dimming, until they return to zero if not pressed again. Implicit constraints of the game include ensuring actions remain within the grid boundaries and avoiding occupancy conflicts where multiple presses affect the same cell. The game can end in two ways: either when the step count reaches 20 or if all four 2x2 sections of the grid are successfully lit, referred to as lightsOn1, lightsOn2, lightsOn3, and lightsOn4. Winning conditions are met if any of these sections are fully lit, granting the robot a score of 100. Failure to light up any section by the terminal condition results in a score of 0. Through strategic presses and attention to the dimming mechanics, the robot seeks to achieve maximum illumination across the grid within the constraints of the turn limit.
