The game is set on a grid-like board, with specific coordinates defining the movement and position of a kitten, the sole player role. The board is 15 columns wide and 4 rows high, with certain fields blocked by walls or fire. The game begins with the kitten positioned at coordinates (8, 2) and the round counter set to 0. Players take turns in a sequential manner, with the kitten being the only active role. The primary objective is for the kitten to navigate from its starting position to the goal located at (15, 4), avoiding the increasing fire that consumes one column from the left each round. During each turn, the player can choose from a set of legal moves, including up, down, left, or right, as long as the destination is within the boardâ€™s boundaries and adjacent to the current position. If a move is made, the kitten's position updates to the new coordinates, and the round counter increases by one. The game incorporates implicit constraints such as boundary limits, preventing the kitten from moving into walls or previously blocked fields. The game concludes under one of three terminal conditions: the kitten reaches the goal, the fire overtakes the kitten's position, or the maximum number of rounds (16) is reached. Victory is achieved if the kitten successfully reaches the goal, earning a score of 100. If the kitten is overtaken by the fire or the game ends after 16 rounds without reaching the goal, the player receives a score of 0.
