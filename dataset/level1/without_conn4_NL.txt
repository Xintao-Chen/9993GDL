The game Connect 4 is set on a 7-column by 6-row vertical grid, where two players, denoted as "white" and "black," take turns dropping their respective markers, "x" for white and "o" for black, into one of the columns. The game's initial state features an empty board, with each cell marked as "b" for blank, and white controls the first move. Players alternate turns, and if a player has no legal moves, they perform a "noop" action, effectively passing their turn. A move is considered legal if the top cell of a chosen column is empty, ensuring that markers drop to the lowest available position within that column, and the current player controls the board. As players make their moves, cells become permanently marked with the player's respective symbol. The game imposes constraints such as maintaining the board boundaries, ensuring markers do not float, and preventing overlaying other markers that are already placed. The game ends when a player connects four of their markers in a row, column, or diagonal, or when the board is entirely filled without any player achieving a Connect 4. The scoring system awards 100 points to the player who achieves a Connect 4 and zero to the opponent, while a filled board without a Connect 4 for either player results in a draw with both players receiving 50 points. The game terminates when a Connect 4 is achieved or the board fills, ensuring a definitive outcome based on the described victory criteria.
