In this game, the environment is structured with a sequence of depth levels, starting from level1 and progressing through to level5, which also signifies the terminal condition when reached. The robot is the sole player role, and it is responsible for making moves in a specific order, determined by the depth of the game. The initial state sets the game at depth level1 with a previous goal of zero. Players take turns by choosing a direction to move, which can be c1, c2, c3, or c4, and these moves are governed by specific legality conditions that depend on the current state and previously made choices. The game uses a noop mechanism to maintain continuity by carrying forward previous choices into the next state unless a new move is distinguished, at which point a new choice point is added. Actions by the robot can alter the game's state by either maintaining or redefining the previous goal, with certain conditions triggering automatic events such as the setting of new goals. Implicit constraints include the progression between depth levels and the requirement to avoid occupancy conflicts by adhering to defined choices. The robot's goal, which contributes to scoring, is determined by specific state conditions, and if a state does not define a new goal, the previous goal is used. The game ends when the depth reaches level5, and the robot's score is based on fulfilling criteria outlined in various state-goal mappings, with possible scores being 25, 50, 75, or 100, depending on the choices made at each depth level. The maximum score of 100 is achieved when the robot satisfies the conditions of choices at levels 1 through 4 without conflicting moves.
