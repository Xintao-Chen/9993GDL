The game of Snake, as defined in this code, operates within a grid environment with coordinates ranging from 1 to 4 for both axes, simulating two games running in parallel. There is only one player role, termed "snake," which takes turns in a sequential manner. Initially, the game begins with a step count of zero and the snake occupying cells (1, 1) and (2, 1) on the grid. Players control the snake's movement by issuing commands to move up, down, left, or right. These commands are legal only when the snake's head is not at the boundary of the grid in the direction of movement. The game employs a "noop" mechanism where no move is made if none are legal, thus preserving the state. Actions lead to state changes where the snake moves forward, and body parts shift accordingly unless a collision occurs. Implicit constraints include the grid boundaries, which prevent movement outside the defined coordinates, and occupancy conflicts where the snake cannot move into a cell already occupied by its body. The game reaches a terminal state either when a collision occurs or when the step count reaches 20. Scoring is based on achieving a goal of 100 points, which is awarded when a snake completely fills a grid index, meaning no open cells remain. If both grids have open cells, the player scores zero. This setup ensures a strategic challenge where maintaining control of the snake's movement and avoiding collisions are crucial for success.
