The game is set in an environment featuring four heaps labeled a, b, c, and d, each initially containing 12, 12, 20, and 20 units respectively. Players assume the roles of player1 and player2, with player1 starting the game. Players take turns alternatively, with control switching to the other player after each move. During their turn, a player can either perform a noop action, which means doing nothing, or opt to reduce the number of units in one of the heaps. The noop action is only legal if the player does not have control, whereas a reduction is allowed if the player has control and the number to reduce (n) is smaller than the current number of units in the chosen heap (m). Once a player decides to reduce a heap, the game's state is updated to reflect this change, and the heap's count is decreased by the chosen amount. The control then shifts to the other player. Implicit constraints include the board boundaries ensuring that the heaps cannot have negative units and the occupancy conflicts are managed by the rules that prevent illegal reductions. The game concludes when all heaps are reduced to zero, marking the terminal condition. At the end of the game, the player who last had control of the game wins and is awarded a score of 100, while the other player receives a score of 0. Victory is determined by successfully depleting all heaps while maintaining control. The game includes a mechanism to compare numerical values, which is used to define legal reduction actions, and the sequence in which successors are defined ensures that only valid reductions are possible.
