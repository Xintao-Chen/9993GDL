In the game of Copolymer, designed by Mark Steere, the environment consists of a unique board where the vertical axis is represented using the "x" coordinate, and each row varies in length, forming an irregular grid. The player roles are defined as red and blue, with red taking the first turn as per the initial state settings. The game begins with both players having zero pieces on the board. Turn control is managed by alternating between players, with the noop mechanism available for players not in control, allowing them to pass their turn if needed. A player's move is formatted as (move ?x ?n), where ?x and ?n denote the coordinates of the cell on the board. A move is legal if the player is currently in control and the targeted cell is empty. The state changes triggered by these actions include placing a piece of the player's color in the chosen cell and potentially altering the control of the game depending on the adjacency of opposing pieces. If two adjacent opposing pieces are formed by a move, control remains with the current player; otherwise, it shifts to the opponent. Implicit constraints include ensuring moves are within the valid boundaries of the board, adherence to the distance relationships between connected cells, and the avoidance of occupancy conflicts by placing pieces only in empty cells. The game reaches a terminal state when a player has 19 pieces on the board, at which point the player is declared the winner. The victory criterion is straightforward: the first player to reach a piece count of 19 wins the game, earning a score of 100, while the opponent scores 0. The board's structure and the rules governing movement and control create a dynamic and strategic environment, challenging players to manage their pieces while countering their opponent's advances.
