The game is set on a 3x3 grid where players take on the roles of either 'xplayer' or 'oplayer' and alternate turns to mark the grid. The game begins with all cells in the grid initialized to 'b' for blank, and the initial step is set to 1. Players take turns marking a cell with either an 'x' or an 'o', with 'xplayer' typically starting first. The 'noop' mechanism ensures that if a player cannot make a move, their turn is effectively skipped without any action. A move is considered legal if a player marks a blank cell. The transition of game states is managed such that a cell changes from blank to either 'x' or 'o' when a player marks it, and the step counter is incremented. The game's implicit constraints include ensuring that players cannot mark an already occupied cell and maintaining the grid boundaries. The game continues until a terminal condition is met, such as when all steps are exhausted with the grid fully marked or when a player achieves a line of three consecutive marks either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Victory conditions are determined by scoring: if 'xplayer' or 'oplayer' creates a line of their marks while preventing the opponent from doing so, they score 100 points; if both players create lines simultaneously, they both score 50 points; if neither player forms a line by the end of the game, it results in a draw with both scoring 50 points. If one player alone creates a line, the other scores 0. The game concludes when one of these terminal conditions is satisfied.
