The game "LightsOn" is played in an environment consisting of a 4x4 grid, with each cell initially set to a state of 0, indicating they are off. The game involves a single player role, identified as "robot," which takes turns to interact with the grid. The game begins with every cell on the grid initialized to the off state, and the current step is set to 0. The player can issue a "press" action with four coordinates, where each coordinate ranges from 1 to 4, corresponding to the grid's dimensions. The legal action involves selecting any two cells on the grid as specified by these coordinates. When a cell is pressed, it transitions to a brighter state from 0 to 4, incrementing one step with each press. The game includes a noop mechanism through which the player can choose not to press any cells, allowing the turn to pass without altering the grid state. The game's implicit constraints ensure that actions are confined within the board's boundaries, and that a cell's state will not exceed 4. The game's primary objective is to achieve a state where all cells in any of the four 2x2 quadrants of the grid are turned on, with each quadrant having its own terminal condition. The game concludes either when one of these quadrants is fully lit or when 20 steps have been reached without achieving this condition. Victory is determined by lighting up any of the quadrants, which earns the robot a score of 100. If none of the quadrants are fully lit by step 20, the robot scores 0. Thus, the game's challenge lies in efficiently managing the sequence of presses to light up a quadrant within the step limit.
