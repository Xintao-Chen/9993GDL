The game is set in a turn-based environment featuring two player roles, white and black, who alternately take turns. Each player can choose from four possible actions: rock, paper, scissors, and well. The game begins with the initial state where the step is set to s1, and both players have a beaten count at s0. During a turn, both players select an action, and the legality of these actions is based on the player's role, allowing them to choose any of the four actions. The outcome of each turn is determined by the interaction of the chosen actions, where certain actions beat others based on predefined rules: rock beats scissors, paper beats rock and well, scissors beats paper, and well beats both scissors and rock. If a player's action beats the other player's, their beaten count is incremented by one. If no player beats the other, the beaten count remains unchanged. The game's state progresses automatically with each turn, advancing the step from s1 up to s10. Implicit constraints ensure that actions are only compared when selected by distinct players, avoiding occupancy conflicts. The game reaches a terminal state if a player reaches a beaten count of s5 or if the step reaches s10. Scoring is determined by comparing the beaten counts of the players: the player with the higher beaten count receives a score of 100, while the other receives 0. If both players have the same beaten count, both receive a score of 50. The game's structure ensures that each player's turn and the resulting state changes are clearly defined, allowing for a competitive experience in this strategic environment.
