The game environment for this variant of Connect Four is set on a grid with columns numbered from 1 to 8 and rows from 1 to 6, where three players—Red, Yellow, and Blue—take turns in that specific order. In the initial state, the control is given to the Red player. Each player, when it is their turn, can legally perform one of two actions: they can choose to drop a disc into an open column, or they can opt to perform a noop action, which signifies passing their turn if they are not in control. The legality of dropping a disc depends on whether the column is open, meaning there is at least one empty cell in that column. When a player drops a disc in a column, it occupies the lowest available cell, and control is then transferred to the next player in the sequence. The game progresses with Red followed by Yellow, then Blue. Implicit constraints include the board's boundaries, ensuring discs are only placed within the grid, and avoiding occupancy conflicts by checking if a cell is already occupied. The game reaches a terminal condition when a player forms a line of four consecutive discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or if there are no open spaces left on the board. The scoring system assigns 100 points to a player who successfully forms a line, 50 points to an assisting player when their assisted player forms a line, and 0 points to players when neither condition is met or when a player has assisted another player who wins. The assists are predefined relationships where Red assists Yellow, Yellow assists Blue, and Blue assists Red, adding a layer of strategic alliances to the gameplay.
