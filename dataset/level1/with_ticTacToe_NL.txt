The game is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe played on a 3x3 grid, where each cell is identified by coordinates using indices 1, 2, and 3 for both rows and columns. Two players, xplayer and oplayer, take turns to mark the cells, with xplayer always starting the game. Initially, the board is empty, represented by 'b' in all cells, and xplayer has control. Players alternate turns, and during their turn, each can legally mark an empty cell, provided it is their turn to control. If a cell is already marked by either player, it cannot be marked again, ensuring no conflicts in cell occupancy. The game's turn mechanism includes a noop action, which is allowed for the player not in control, ensuring that no action is taken out of turn. A player wins by completing a line of their marksâ€”either a row, column, or diagonal. The game concludes when either player forms such a line, or if all cells are filled without any player completing a line, resulting in a draw. Scoring is determined by these conditions: a player achieving a line receives a score of 100, while if neither player completes a line and the board is full, both players score 50. A player scores 0 if the opponent completes a line. The boundaries of the board implicitly constrain play, as actions cannot occur outside the defined grid coordinates.
