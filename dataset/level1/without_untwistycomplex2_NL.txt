In the game "Untwisty Corridor," the environment features a linear progression system where a single player, the robot, navigates through a series of states. The game begins with the robot in the initial state labeled q1, and the step count set to 1. The robot alone takes turns, and each turn involves selecting one of the legal actions, denoted by letters a through h. The robot can either move forward through these actions or decide to do nothing, a situation managed by what is termed the noop mechanism, where the state does not change if no action is taken. Each action has a straightforward format, being a simple choice among the available legal actions, and is considered legal as long as the robot selects from these given options. The state transitions depend on the robot's chosen action; performing actions a through g keeps the robot in states q1 or p, while action h, when used in specific conditions such as when p is not true, allows progression through states q2 to q8. Implicit constraints in the game include the necessity of following the succession of steps, as defined from 1 to 8, and the requirement that conditions must be met to advance states, particularly with action h. The game reaches a terminal condition when the step count reaches 8, marking the end of the game. The scoring system is binary; the robot achieves victory and scores 100 if it successfully reaches state q8, otherwise, it scores 0. The boundaries are defined by the succession order and the linear nature of the state progression, with no complex spatial or occupancy constraints, focusing instead on a sequence of correct actions to reach the desired terminal state.
