The game "coins" is played in a linear environment with a sequence of cells, each identified by a number from 1 to 8. The player, referred to as "you," is the sole participant in the game and takes all the turns. The game begins with each of the eight cells containing one coin, and the step counter is set to 1. During a player's turn, they can perform a "jump" action, which requires selecting two cells, both of which must contain one coin each. Additionally, there must be a certain relationship between the cells, where either there are two coins situated between them in sequence, or the reverse. When a jump is executed, the first cell is emptied of coins, and the second cell is filled with two coins. The step counter is then incremented. A turn in which no action is taken is represented by a "noop" or no-operation. The game imposes implicit constraints, such as the linear boundaries of the board and the requirement of these stepwise relationships between cells for actions to be legal. The game reaches a terminal state when no legal moves are possible. The scoring system is straightforward: the player achieves a goal of 100 points if they reach step 5, indicating successful progression through the game. However, if any cell still contains one coin at the end of the game, the player's score is zero.
