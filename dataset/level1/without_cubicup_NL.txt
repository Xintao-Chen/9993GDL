The game takes place in a three-dimensional cubic environment with a coordinate system ranging from (0,0,0) to (6,6,6), initially populated with a series of "ground" cubes forming a base layer. Players take on the roles of either yellow or red, with yellow beginning the game. Each player starts with 28 cubes, and control alternates between the players throughout the game. A player can either place a cube on the board or choose to do nothing (noop), but the latter is only legal if it is the opponent's turn to act. A move is legal if the player has control and there is an open cubicup position for the opponent, or if there is no open cubicup, provided that the new cube is directly above a filled position. A cube placement automatically reduces the player's cube count and updates the game state to reflect the new cube on the board. Players must adhere to implicit constraints such as board boundaries, ensuring cubes are placed within the 7x7x7 grid, and not placing cubes in already filled positions. The game concludes when the last cube position (6,6,6) is filled. Scoring is based on control of the last cube; if a player successfully places their cube at the last position without the opponent forming a cubicup at that location, they score 100 and win. If the opponent forms a cubicup at the last position, they score 50, and the current player scores 0. The player's objective is to maximize their score by strategically placing cubes and preventing the opponent from completing cubicup formations, ultimately aiming to control the last cube for a decisive victory.
