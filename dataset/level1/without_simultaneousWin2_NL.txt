The game is set on a 4x4 grid with coordinates ranging from (1,1) to (4,4), where each cell initially holds a value of 0. There is a single player role, the robot, which takes turns by pressing two pairs of coordinates. The initial state of the game has all cells set to 0, indicating that no lights are on. In each turn, the robot can perform a "press" action, which is legal as long as the coordinates for both pairs are within the index range of 1 to 4. The action of pressing a cell at coordinates (?x, ?y) triggers that cell to change its state to 4, indicating that the light in that cell is turned on. The game's state evolves as cells with a value of 4 decrease their value down to 0 through intermediate states in subsequent turns, simulating a light dimming process. Implicit constraints include the boundaries of the board, meaning the robot cannot press outside the 4x4 grid, and there are no occupancy conflicts as each cell operates independently. The game reaches a terminal state when specific groups of lights, defined as lightson12, lightson13, lightson14, lightson23, lightson24, or lightson34, are all turned on simultaneously. These groups represent various combinations of cells where the lights must be on to satisfy the condition. The victory criterion is met when any of these group conditions are satisfied, awarding the robot a score of 100. If none of these conditions are met by the end of the game, the score remains 0.
