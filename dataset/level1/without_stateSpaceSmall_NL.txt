In this game, a single player takes on the role of a robot navigating a structured environment characterized by a depth-level coordinate system. The game begins with the robot positioned at depth level1 and a previous goal value set to zero. The player controls the robot by selecting a move direction from the available options—c1, c2, c3, or c4—during each turn. The legal moves are defined by these directions, and the player must choose one direction per turn. The game employs a mechanism to maintain the robot's previous choices, ensuring continuity in the game's state across turns. As the game progresses, the depth level is incremented, moving from level1 to level2 and so on, up to level5. Each action the robot undertakes may trigger changes in the state, such as updating choice points or setting a new previous goal if one is defined by the current state goal. The game also has implicit constraints, such as boundaries within the coordinate system and conflicts that arise from certain occupancy conditions, though these are not explicitly stated. Terminal conditions are reached when the depth level advances to level5, marking the end of the game. The robot's objective is to achieve various state goals that grant scores of 25, 50, 75, or 100 points, depending on satisfying specific criteria related to the robot's choices at different depth levels. These criteria involve combinations of moves that must be made or avoided. The scoring system is pivotal to the victory criteria, with the robot's ultimate aim being to accumulate the highest score possible by the game's conclusion.
