In the game called LightsOn, which involves four games played simultaneously, a single player takes on the role of a robot. The game is set in a grid environment with coordinates ranging from (1,1) to (4,4). Initially, each cell in this 4x4 grid is set to a state of 0, and the game's progression is tracked by a step counter starting at 0. The player, acting as the robot, takes turns by pressing any cell at coordinates (x, y), provided these coordinates are within the grid's boundaries. This action is only legal if both x and y are valid indices within the specified range. When a cell is pressed, its state changes to 4, and in subsequent turns, the state of each cell automatically decrements by one until it reaches 0, unless the cell is pressed again. The game reaches a terminal state under two conditions: either all cells in one of the four quadrants on the grid are "on," meaning they have a state of 1 or more, or the step counter reaches 20. The robot player achieves a perfect score of 100 if all cells in any of the four designated quadrants are turned on, indicating the successful completion of that section of the grid. If none of the quadrants are fully lit by the end of the 20 steps, the robot scores 0. Implicit constraints include ensuring all actions occur within the grid boundaries and managing the state transitions of the cells based on the player's actions and the automatic countdown mechanism.
