Atari Go is a simplified variant of the traditional Go game, designed with specific rules and objectives. The game is played on a grid defined by a coordinate system with indices ranging from 1 to 7, creating a board environment where players can place their stones. The game involves two players, designated as black and white, who alternate turns. Black always makes the first move, as the initial state sets black as the player in control. Players take turns by either placing a stone at an unoccupied coordinate or performing a noop action if they are not the current player in control. The noop mechanism is legal only when the player is not the active player. A move is considered legal if the player in control places a stone on an empty space, which is defined as a position not currently occupied by any stone. When a stone is placed, it may form or join a group, which is a set of connected stones of the same color. The board imposes implicit constraints such as boundaries, preventing stones from being placed outside the 7x7 area, and ensures that groups of stones respect adjacency rules. A critical aspect of the game is the concept of liberties, or the empty spaces adjacent to a group of stones. A group without any liberties can be captured, leading to a win condition. The game reaches a terminal state if any player has a group of stones without liberties. The primary objective is to capture an opponent's stone, and the winner is determined when a move results in the opponent having a group of stones without liberties while the current player's stones are safe. If a player manages to capture an opponent's stone, they are declared the winner and awarded a score of 100, while the opponent receives a score of 0. In cases where neither player captures a stone, the game can end in a draw, awarding each player a score of 50. The game rules enforce that the active player cannot pass, meaning they must play a stone on every turn, and the alternation of control between black and white continues until a terminal condition is met.
