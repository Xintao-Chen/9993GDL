In this game environment, the coordinate system is based on two independent subgames, each with its own set of positions and connections. The player takes on the singular role of navigating these subgames, specifically moving between positions in two separate graphs: graph 1 involves a sequence of positions a, b, and c, while graph 2 consists of x, y, and z. The game begins with the initial state where position pos1 is set to a and position pos2 is set to x. During each turn, the player can perform one of two actions: move1 or move2, each associated with a target position. The move1 action is legal if the current position in pos1 is connected to the target position via conn1, and similarly, move2 is legal if the current position in pos2 is connected to the target position via conn2. State changes are triggered by these actions, resulting in the updating of the positions pos1 and pos2 as per the executed move. The game applies implicit constraints such as ensuring movements respect the boundaries of the graphs and maintaining the integrity of the defined connections. The game reaches a terminal condition when specific combinations of positions are achieved, such as pos1 being c and pos2 being z, or other specified end states. The player scores a victory with a goal score of 100 if they successfully navigate pos1 to c and pos2 to z, while any deviation from achieving both these end positions results in a score of 0. The design of the game highlights the complexity in planning, as even though the subgames have straightforward local plans, combining them into a global strategy is non-trivial.
