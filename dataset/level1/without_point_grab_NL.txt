In this game, there are two players with the roles designated as "first" and "second." The game begins with both players having zero points and the step counter set to zero. Each player can choose from a variety of actions on their turn, including scream, shout, cry, whine, a_point, b_point, complain, sulk, grumble, and mope. Notably, there is no explicit board or coordinate system, and actions are not spatially constrained, but players must alternate turns, and the game progresses through these sequential steps. The noop mechanism is implicit in the sense that any action is permitted as long as it corresponds to a player's role. The legality of an action is determined solely by the player's role, allowing for a wide range of strategic choices. When a player performs the actions a_point or b_point and the opponent does not perform the same action simultaneously, the acting player gains five points. This is the primary way to accumulate points. The state of the game evolves automatically after each action, with the step counter incrementing and points being adjusted accordingly. The game concludes when either 30 steps have elapsed or when a player reaches 100 points. Victory is determined by the player who achieves the highest score, or if a player reaches 100 points before the final step, they are immediately declared the winner.
