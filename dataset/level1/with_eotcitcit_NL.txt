The game, identified as "Eotcitcit," is played on a 3x3 grid where each cell is initially marked as empty, denoted by 'b.' Two players, referred to as "white" and "black," take turns marking the grid, with white typically going first. The game progresses in turns, tracked by a step counter starting at 1 and incrementing with each move until it reaches 7, at which point the game concludes if no player has won. Players take turns marking an empty cell on the grid, and an action is considered legal if the chosen cell is unoccupied. The players aim to fill a row, column, or diagonal with their respective marks ('x' for white and 'o' for black), which would constitute a line and potentially end the game prematurely. The game also ends when all cells are filled without any line being formed. The scoring system awards 100 points to a player if they complete a line with their mark while the opponent does not, whereas a draw or both players completing a line results in each player receiving 50 points. If neither player completes a line, the game is a draw, and both players get 50 points. Implicit constraints include ensuring players do not mark already occupied cells, and the game confines actions within the 3x3 grid boundaries, maintaining integrity in marking sequences and score allocation.
