In the game of 6-Player 3D-Tictactoe, the environment is a three-dimensional grid with coordinates ranging from 1 to 3 on each axis, creating a cubic space of 27 cells. Six players are divided into two teams, with each team representing a different symbol: 'x' or 'o'. The roles in the game are assigned as xrow, xcolumn, xlevel for team 'x', and orow, ocolumn, olevel for team 'o'. These roles determine which dimension each player can select on their turn; for example, xrow selects a row, xcolumn selects a column, and xlevel selects a level. The game starts with the control assigned to xrow, and the sequence of turns proceeds as follows: xrow, xcolumn, xlevel, orow, ocolumn, and olevel, looping indefinitely. Each player can perform a 'select' action, choosing a coordinate on their designated dimension, provided that the cell at this coordinate is unoccupied ('b' for blank). If a player cannot make a move, they perform a 'noop'. Actions must adhere to implicit constraints, such as staying within the boundaries of the grid and not selecting already occupied cells. Upon selecting a valid cell, the state of the game updates, marking the selected cell with the player's symbol ('x' or 'o'), and control passes to the next player. The game terminates when a player forms a straight line of three of their symbols in any of the 13 possible directions within the cube or when all cells are filled, leaving no open spaces. Scoring is straightforward: a player who creates a line receives 100 points, while players who do not create a line and do not lose receive 50 points, and those on the losing team receive 0 points. If no player forms a line and the board fills completely, the game results in a draw, with all players receiving 50 points.
