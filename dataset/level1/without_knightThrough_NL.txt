The game is played on an 8x8 grid where each cell is identified by its coordinates, ranging from 1 to 8 on both axes. Two players, designated as "white" and "black," participate, taking turns in sequence. The game begins with white controlling the bottom two rows of the grid, as all cells from (1, 1) to (8, 2) are occupied by white pieces, while black occupies the top two rows from (1, 7) to (8, 8). Initially, the white player has control and may choose to either move a piece or perform a noop action, which effectively passes the turn. The legality of any move depends on several conditions: the player must control the turn, the starting cell must contain one of their pieces, the move must conform to a knight-like pattern characteristic of chess, and the destination cell must not already be occupied by one of their pieces. A move updates the game state by relocating the piece and switching control to the opposing player. Implicit constraints include ensuring moves remain within the board boundaries and that distinct cells are non-overlapping. The game concludes when a player achieves a "win" condition, which occurs if a white piece reaches the top row or a black piece reaches the bottom row, or if one player completely eliminates the other's pieces. Victory for white or black results in a score of 100 for the winning player and 0 for the losing player.
