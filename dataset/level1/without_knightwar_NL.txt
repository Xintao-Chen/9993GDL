The game is set in a grid-based environment with an 11x11 coordinate system, where players take on the roles of red, yellow, green, blue, and orange. Each player begins the game with a specific starting position: red at (6, 11), yellow at (1, 6), green at (11, 6), blue at (4, 1), and orange at (8, 1). Initially, all players have a score of zero. In each turn, players can either make a move or perform a noop if they are considered "dead". The legal moves are defined by the knight's move in chess, meaning a player can move in an L-shape, which involves two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular. A move is only legal if it starts from the player's current position, and a player is not already considered dead. If a player moves to a cell occupied by another player or a hole, they are marked as dead, and their turn becomes a noop. The game progresses with players taking turns in a specific sequence, and each successful move increases the playerâ€™s score based on a predefined scoring system. The game ends when all players are dead, and the final scores determine the winner. Players must navigate the board while avoiding collisions and strategically positioning themselves to maximize their score. The implicit constraints include board boundaries that restrict movement to within the 11x11 grid, and a player cannot occupy the same cell as another player or a hole without becoming dead. A player's score increases with each move, reflecting their progress and strategic acumen, with the highest score at the end of the game determining the victor.
