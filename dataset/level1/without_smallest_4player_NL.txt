The game is designed for four players, identified as player1, player2, player3, and player4, who take turns in sequence. The game begins in an initial state where the round is set to 1, and each player starts with a score of zero. During each turn, a player may perform the action of selecting a number from a predefined set ranging from 1 to 10, with the condition that the action is legal if the player is a recognized participant and the selected number is within the allowed range. The game's progression is governed by transition rules where, after each round, the round number increments, and scores may change depending on the selections. If two players select the same number, no score changes occur for that number. However, if a player selects a number greater than another player's unique selection, the former player does not score. Conversely, if a player's selection is unique and not smaller than any other player's unique selection, they earn an additional ten points. The game concludes when either 25 rounds have been completed or a player reaches a score of 100 points. The winner is determined based on the final scores, with each player's score reflecting their performance throughout the game. Implicitly, the game confines selections to the set numbers, and scoring is influenced by both uniqueness and comparative value of selected numbers.
