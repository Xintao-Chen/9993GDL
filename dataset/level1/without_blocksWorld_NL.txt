In the Blocks World game, the environment consists of a simple arrangement of blocks and a table, with coordinates implied by the relationships between blocks rather than a specific grid system. The game features a single player role, the robot, which takes turns to manipulate the blocks. The initial state sets up the blocks with block 'c' on block 'a', and both blocks 'b' and 'c' are clear, meaning nothing is stacked on top of them. Additionally, blocks 'a' and 'b' are on the table, and the game commences with step 1. The player controls the game through actions that either stack one block on another or unstack a block from another. A special noop mechanism is not explicitly detailed, but the game's progression is inherently turn-based. Each action must adhere to specific conditions: a block can only be moved if it is clear and on the table, or if it is clear and stacked on another block; the destination must also be clear and distinct from the block being moved. These actions lead to changes in the game state, such as updating which blocks are on others or which blocks are clear. Implicit constraints include the fact that blocks cannot occupy the same position simultaneously, and the stacking actions respect these spatial relationships. The game reaches a terminal state when either four steps have been taken or when block 'a' is on block 'b', and block 'b' is on block 'c'. Scoring is binary: the robot achieves a goal of 100 points if it successfully stacks block 'a' on 'b' and 'b' on 'c' before the end of the game. If it fails to achieve this configuration, the score is 0. The game is thus a challenge of efficiently achieving the correct stack within the allowed number of steps.
