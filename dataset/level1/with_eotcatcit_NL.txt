The game takes place in a 3x3 grid environment where two players, known as white and black, take turns marking the board. The initial state of the game is set with all cells of the grid being empty, denoted by 'b', and the control given to the white player to make the first move. The players alternate turns, with control switching between white and black after each move. If a player cannot make a move, they perform a 'noop' action, which effectively passes their turn to the opponent. Players mark the grid by placing their designated marker, 'x' for white and 'o' for black, on any empty cell. An action is considered legal if the cell is empty and it is the player's turn. Any action taken results in a state change where the cell is updated with the player's marker, and control is passed to the other player. The game is constrained by the board boundaries, ensuring no moves are made outside the 3x3 grid, and players must avoid marking already occupied cells. The game reaches a terminal state when a player successfully completes a row, column, or diagonal with their marker, or when there are no empty cells left. Scoring is based on these terminal conditions: if black completes a line with 'x', they score 100 points, while white scores 0. Conversely, if white completes a line with 'o', they score 100 points, and black scores 0. If neither player completes a line and no empty cells remain, the game ends in a draw, with both players scoring 50 points.
