In this game, the environment is defined by a set of states and transitions, with the players taking on the roles of red, white, and blue. The game operates within a system of coordinates that is not explicitly described but relies on state transitions and actions to dictate movement and process. The initial state of the game includes the states 'off', 'red', 'dim', and 'start'. Players take turns in the order of red, white, and blue, each having specific actions they can perform. Red can execute actions 'a' and 'b', white can perform 'c' and 'd', and blue can choose between 'e' and 'f'. The game includes a noop mechanism, where if a player does not perform an action, the state remains unchanged for that turn. Legal actions trigger state changes: performing action 'a' by red transitions 'off' to 'on', while 'b' reverts 'on' back to 'off'; white's 'c' changes 'red' to 'green', and 'd' changes 'green' back to 'red'; blue's 'e' shifts 'dim' to 'bright', and 'f' reverts 'bright' to 'dim'. Implicit constraints include the fact that certain states cannot coexist, as actions are designed to toggle states between two possibilities. The game reaches its terminal condition when the state 'end' is achieved, transitioning automatically from 'start'. Scoring criteria are based on the final states: red scores 100 if 'on' is true, otherwise 0; white scores 100 if 'green' is true, otherwise 0; blue scores 100 if 'bright' is true, otherwise 0. The player with the highest score at the end of the game is declared the winner. The game emphasizes strategic choices based on state transitions and the timing of actions to maximize scores and reach the terminal state.
