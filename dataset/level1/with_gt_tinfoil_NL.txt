The game "Tinfoil Hat" is set in a theoretical framework where two players, designated as the flipper and the caller, take turns making decisions in a simulated environment with no spatial coordinates or board boundaries to consider. Initially, both players start with a score of zero and the game is at step zero. Players have the option to perform one of three actions: call "heads," call "tails," or choose "neither," which essentially means refusing to participate in the coin flip. The players' turns are sequential, and any player can choose to perform a noop, or no operation, by selecting "neither." For an action to be legal, it must align with the player's role, therefore each player can legally call "heads," "tails," or "neither" during their turn. If the caller and flipper select the same option, the caller wins the round and receives ten points, while the flipper receives none. Conversely, if they choose differently, the flipper wins ten points and the caller receives none. Should a player choose "neither," they automatically receive one point, while the opponent gains nine points unless they also select "neither," in which case both players gain one point. Implicit constraints include the fact that both players must choose from the same set of actions with no spatial or distance-related limitations, and there are no occupancy conflicts as actions are independent of each other. The game automatically progresses to the next step after each round is completed, and it terminates after ten steps. The player's final score at the end of these ten steps determines the outcome, with higher scores indicating victory. The game relies on the concept that refusing to participate is only logical if one suspects the opponent has the ability to predict their choice, hence the whimsical implication of wearing a "tinfoil hat."
