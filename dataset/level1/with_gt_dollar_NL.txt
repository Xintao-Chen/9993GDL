In the game known as the Dollar Auction, two players, designated as white and black, take turns in a strategic bid for a prize, initially starting with 16 points each, which translates to a score of 80 points due to the scoring system where a player's total points are multiplied by five. The game begins with the white player in control of the first turn. On a player's turn, they have the option to either lay claim to the prize by spending one point, provided they have points remaining, or to end the game. Additionally, a player may choose to take no action during their turn, represented by the noop mechanism, which means they pass control to their opponent. Each player's action must adhere to certain conditions; for instance, laying claim to the prize requires that the player is currently in control and has at least one point to spend. When a player lays claim, their score decreases by one point, whereas if they end the game, the player who last laid claim receives an additional five points to their score. The game continues with alternating turns until a player decides to end it, at which point the game's terminal condition is met. The final scores are determined by the points accumulated by each player, and the victory criteria involve maximizing one's score, with the maximum possible score being 100. Implicit constraints include the turn-based nature of the game, the requirement for players to have points to lay claim, and the occupancy conflict over the prize. The game is strategically rich, as players must decide whether to continue spending points for a potentially larger reward or to end the game to secure their current standing.
