The game environment of this version of Tic-Tac-Toe is set on a 3x3 grid, where each cell can be occupied by an 'x', 'o', or remain blank ('b'). The players in the game are designated as xplayer and oplayer, with xplayer taking the first turn according to the initial setup. The game begins with an unusual initial state: the grid has 'o' on cell (1,2), 'x' on cells (3,1) and (3,3), and 'o' on cell (3,2), while all other cells are blank. The game's turn control mechanism alternates between the two players, allowing each to either mark an empty cell or perform a noop (no operation) if it's not their turn. Each player can legally mark a cell if it is their turn and the cell is currently blank. Any action taken by a player results in a state change where the specified cell is marked with the player's symbol, and control switches to the other player. Implicit constraints include the grid's boundaries, meaning players can only mark within the 3x3 area, and no occupancy conflicts are allowed, as players can only mark blank cells. The game reaches a terminal state if a player forms a line of three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or if there are no open cells left. Scoring criteria dictate that a player achieves a score of 100 if they complete a line of their symbols, 50 if the board is full without a winner, and 0 if the opponent completes a line. The game is primarily about completing a line or preventing the opponent from doing so while managing the initial non-standard configuration.
