In the game "Maze," the environment is structured around a coordinate system with specific locations labeled as a, b, c, and d, which are connected adjacently in a loop. The player takes on the role of the "robot," who is the sole participant and thus operates independently, taking turns in a sequential and unopposed manner. The game begins with the robot positioned at location 'a,' while a piece of gold is initially placed at location 'c.' The game tracks progression through a step counter that starts at 1. During each turn, the robot can perform one of three actions: move, grab, or drop. The move action is only legal if the robot's current position is adjacent to the target position, aligning with the predefined adjacency rules. The robot can grab the gold if it is on the same cell as the gold, and it can drop the gold at its current position only if it is carrying the gold, denoted by the gold being held at a special location 'i.' Legal actions are determined by the current game state, and if no legal action is possible, a "noop" or no-operation action can occur, essentially passing the turn. When a move is executed, the robot advances to an adjacent cell, and if a grab occurs, the gold moves with the robot or stays put if it's not picked up. Dropping the gold places it at the robot's current location. Implicit constraints include respecting board boundaries and adjacency relationships, ensuring the robot cannot move to non-adjacent cells or occupy the same space as the gold unless picking it up. The game reaches a terminal state either when the step counter reaches 10 or if the gold is successfully moved to location 'a.' The scoring criteria are straightforward: the robot achieves victory and scores 100 points if the gold is placed at location 'a'; otherwise, if the terminal condition is met without the gold being at 'a,' the score remains at 0.
