The game takes place in an abstract environment using a coordinate system centered on four heaps labeled a, b, c, and d, each with initial counts of 2, 2, 10, and 10, respectively. There are two players, named player1 and player2, who take turns alternately, starting with player1. The initial state of the game is defined by the counts in these heaps and the control being with player1. During their turn, a player can choose to either perform a noop action, which means doing nothing, or they can perform a reduction action on a heap, reducing it by a specified number, provided that the reduction is smaller than the current count of the heap. The noop action is only legal when the player does not have control, while reducing a heap is legal only for the player in control and only if the reduction amount is valid. When an action is performed, the corresponding heap count is updated to reflect the reduction, and control is passed to the other player. The game continues until all heaps are reduced to zero, at which point it becomes terminal. Victory is determined by the player who does not have control at the end of the game, and they are awarded 100 points, while the player in control receives zero points. Implicit constraints include ensuring heap counts do not become negative and that players only act when they have control, maintaining the turn-based structure of the game.
