The game involves two players, referred to as player1 and player2, who take turns to play in a specific order. The initial state of the game is set on a grid where each cell is initially marked with both white and black colors, and player1 is associated with the color white while player2 is associated with the color black. Players take turns to execute actions, which can either be placing their respective colored pieces in a cell or choosing to pass their turn using a noop action if no legal moves are available. Legal actions require the player to place a piece of their color into a cell that is not part of a completed line of that color, and players can only place pieces in cells that are currently unoccupied by a line of their color. The board has implicit boundaries defined by the coordinate system, and players must respect these boundaries without overlapping existing lines. The game automatically updates the state after each action, ensuring that new placements do not conflict with existing lines. Terminal conditions are reached when either player forms a line of three pieces in a row of their color, or when no pieces are left for either color without any new lines being formed. The scoring criteria involve multiple outcomes: a player achieves 100 points if they form a line of three of their own color simultaneously with their opponent, 75 points if they form a line of their own color without the opponent forming any line, and 25 points if the opponent forms a line without the player forming any. A draw, resulting in 50 points for both players, occurs when both form lines simultaneously or if neither player can form any line and no pieces are left. The game's objective is to strategically place pieces to create lines while preventing the opponent from doing the same, ultimately aiming to achieve the highest score possible based on the established victory conditions.
