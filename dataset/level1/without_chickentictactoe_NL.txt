The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where each cell is initially empty and marked with a 'b'. The game features two players, xplayer and oplayer, who take turns marking a cell on the grid. The game begins with xplayer in control. During each turn, the active player can choose to mark an empty cell with their symbol, either 'x' or 'o'. This action is only legal if the cell is currently unoccupied and it is their turn to play. The game enforces implicit constraints, such as ensuring players cannot mark already occupied cells and must operate within the 3x3 grid boundaries. After each move, the control switches to the other player, allowing them to take their turn. The game's progression is determined by the actions of the players, and it automatically updates the state of the board based on these actions. The game concludes under certain terminal conditions: if a player successfully marks three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or if the board is fully occupied without any player achieving such a line. Scoring is determined by these outcomes: a player who creates a line of their symbols scores 100 points and wins, while their opponent scores 0. If the board fills up without any player completing a line, the game ends in a draw, awarding both players 50 points. The ability to take no action, or 'noop', is not applicable in this context, as each player must make a move during their turn if possible.
