The game is a variant of Tic Tac Toe played on a 5x5 grid, where the objective is to win by losing. The game involves two players: xPlayer and oPlayer, who take turns to play, with xPlayer starting the game. In the initial state, xPlayer has control, which alternates between the two players after each valid move. If a player cannot make a move, they can opt for a "noop" action to pass their turn. Each action a player takes must be in the format of placing their respective marker, 'x' or 'o', on an empty cell within the 5x5 grid. A move is considered legal if the cell is unoccupied and it is the player's turn. The state of the game changes with each move, marking the cell with the player's marker and switching control to the other player. The game imposes implicit constraints such as board boundaries, ensuring players only place markers within the 5x5 grid, and occupancy checks to avoid placing a marker in an already occupied cell. The game ends when a player forms a line of their markers, whether horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, or when there are no more open cells left. Scoring is counterintuitive, as the player who forms a line of their markers scores zero, while the opponent scores 100 points. If neither player forms a line and the board is full, both players score 50 points. Thus, the victory is determined by the player who successfully forces the opponent to form a line of markers, thereby losing the game.
