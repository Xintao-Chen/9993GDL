The Centipede Game is a strategic interaction between two players, White and Black, who alternate turns in a sequential manner. The game begins with White in control and possessing an initial payoff of 5, while Black starts with a payoff of 0. At each turn, the player in control can choose to either "finish" the game or "continue". If a player opts to finish, the game ends immediately, and the respective player receives the payoff associated with that decision. If a player chooses to continue, the control switches to the other player, and the payoff amounts adjust according to a predefined succession of values. Specifically, when White continues, the payoff for both players can increase according to a sequence: White's payoff advances by increments defined in the "succ" relations, while Black's payoff advances by larger increments in the same sequence. Conversely, when Black continues, only Black's payoff increases by the next value in the sequence. The "noop" mechanism allows a player to have no legal moves when it is not their turn, maintaining the turn order. The game is played across multiple rounds, with White having the first and last decisions at moves 1 and 17 respectively, and Black making the final decision at move 18. The implicit constraint is that players must adhere to the alternating control and decision sequence, effectively being locked into this turn-based system without spatial or occupancy conflicts. The game can also automatically conclude if Black's payoff reaches 95, regardless of player decisions. The terminal condition is triggered either by the choice to finish or by reaching the maximum payoff sequence. Upon termination, each player’s score is directly determined by their respective payoffs at the end of the game, if the game ends without a decision to finish, both players receive a score of 0. The rational strategy, as suggested by conventional game theory, is for players to finish the game at the earliest opportunity to maximize their individual payoffs, with White logically choosing to finish on the first move to secure 5 points, based on the anticipation of Black’s future decisions.
