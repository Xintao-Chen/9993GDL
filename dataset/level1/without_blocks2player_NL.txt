In the game "Blocks World," there are two player roles: the lifter and the parker, who take turns in that order. The game begins with a specific arrangement of blocks where blocks d, f, and a are on the table, with d on b, b on g, f on c, and c on e, with certain blocks marked as clear and the game starting at step 1. Players can perform actions such as lifting a block, putting a block onto another, or opting for a noop (no operation) if certain conditions are met. The lifter can lift a block if no other block is lifted and the block is clear, while the parker can place a lifted block onto another clear block as long as the blocks are distinct. A noop is allowed for the lifter if a block is lifted and for the parker if no block is lifted. State changes occur based on these actions, updating which block is lifted, which block is on another, and which blocks are clear. The board imposes implicit constraints such as preventing occupancy conflicts and maintaining clear relationships between blocks. The game progresses through steps, with a maximum of 19 steps, and can also end when a specific tower configuration, known as tower2, is achieved. Scoring is based on specific configurations: achieving tower1 and tower2 gives a player 100 points, achieving only tower2 gives 75 points, achieving only tower1 gives 25 points, and achieving neither results in 0 points. The game concludes when either 19 steps are completed or tower2 is formed.
