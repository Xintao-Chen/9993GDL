The game takes place on a 3x3 grid where players alternate turns, with roles defined as xplayer and oplayer. The initial state of the game is characterized by an empty board, where each cell is initialized as blank. The player designated as xplayer starts the game with control. Players take turns marking an empty cell with either an 'x' or an 'o' depending on their role, but they must adhere to the rule that a cell can only be marked if it is currently blank. Furthermore, players can only act on their respective turns, which means that any action attempted out of turn is invalidated by the noop mechanism that maintains turn order. The game disallows winning through diagonal lines, focusing only on horizontal or vertical completions. A player can legally place their mark on the board if it is their turn and the chosen cell is unoccupied. The transition of control between players is automatic after each turn. Implicit constraints include the boundaries of the board and the occupancy of cells; players cannot place a mark outside the 3x3 grid or on an already occupied cell. The game concludes when a player completes a row or column with their marks, or when no empty spaces remain on the board. In terms of scoring, a player achieves a score of 100 and wins by forming a complete line of their marks. If neither player achieves this, and one player can no longer win based on the current board state, the opposing player receives a score of 50. If the game ends without any such conditions being met, both players score 0. The game is thus designed to encourage strategic play within the constraints of turn order and board occupancy, without allowing diagonal victories.
