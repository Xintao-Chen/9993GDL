The game environment consists of two separate tic-tac-toe boards, identified as board1 and board2, each containing nine positions labeled from 'a' to 'i'. The coordinate system for these positions is linear, and each board initially has all positions marked as blank. The game features two roles: the xplayer and the oplayer, with the xplayer initially controlling board1 and the oplayer controlling board2. Players take turns marking a position on their respective boards, with the xplayer moving first on board1 and the oplayer on board2. If a player cannot make a legal move, they can choose to perform a noop, which means doing nothing on their turn. For an action to be legal, a player must mark a blank position on the board they control, unless a line of three Xs or Os is already present, in which case they may only perform a noop. The state changes automatically when a player marks a spot, turning the blank space into either an X or an O, depending on the player. The players alternate control of the boards after each turn. Implicit constraints include not marking a non-blank space and ensuring moves are only made on the playerâ€™s controlled board. The game reaches a terminal state when either both boards have no blank spaces left, or when any line of three Xs or Os is formed on either board. Scoring involves several criteria: a player scores 100 points for forming lines on both boards, 75 points for a line on one board if the other board is free of any lines, and 25 points if the opponent forms a line on one board while the other board remains clear of lines. A score of 50 is awarded to both players if neither board has any remaining open spaces or lines. The game ends when no legal moves are available, or when a line of three identical marks is formed on both boards. The victory criteria are based on these scoring rules, determining the winner by the higher score.
