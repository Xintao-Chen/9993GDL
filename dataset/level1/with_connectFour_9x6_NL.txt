The game is played on a 9-column by 6-row grid, utilizing a coordinate system where columns are numbered 1 through 9 and rows are numbered 1 through 6. Players take on the roles of either "red" or "black", with "red" starting the game. The game begins with "red" in control, and players alternate turns. Each player can either drop a piece into an open column or perform a "noop" action, which effectively passes the turn if it is not their turn to play. A move is considered legal if it is the player's turn and the chosen column is open. Upon executing a drop action, the player's piece occupies the lowest available cell in the column. The control of the game alternates between players after each legal move. Implicit constraints include the boundaries of the board, ensuring pieces are only placed in open cells and within the grid. The game reaches a terminal state when a player forms a line of four consecutive pieces either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when no more moves can be made (i.e., the board is full). Scoring is based on achieving a line of four pieces, with the victorious player receiving 100 points. If the board is full without a winning line, both players score 50 points. A player receives 0 points if the opponent wins, and no additional points are awarded as long as the board remains open and no line is formed. These rules ensure a structured and fair gameplay environment, adhering to the classic Connect Four game dynamics while offering a competitive turn-based challenge.
