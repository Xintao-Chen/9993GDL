In this game, a single player, referred to as "player," interacts within a grid-based environment that utilizes a coordinate system with numerical and alphabetical identifiers. The initial state begins with a step count of zero and all cells on a 3x3 board (coordinates ranging from (1,1) to (3,3)) filled with yellow. The player takes turns, with the option to make a move or perform no operation (noop). A move is formatted as "select ?x ?y," where the player chooses coordinates on the grid. A move is legal if the chosen cell is currently yellow and not all cells in the grid are orange, which is verified through the condition "all_orange numbers." If all cells become orange, the player can legally "celebrate." When a player selects a cell, adjacent yellow cells can change to orange and vice versa, provided they meet certain conditions. The adjacency is defined in both numerical and alphabetical terms for respective parts of the grid. Implicit constraints include the grid boundaries that limit selectable coordinates and the adjacency relationships that influence which cells can change color. The game can terminate either when 15 steps are completed or when all cells in an extended grid, described by "letters," become orange. For scoring, the player receives 100 points if the game ends on step 10 with all cells orange, 80 points if this condition is met on any other step, 40 points if the cell at (a,a) is orange when not all cells are orange, and zero points if the cell at (a,a) is neither yellow nor orange. The game's progression is marked by incrementing the step counter through defined successor relationships, which also determine when the game reaches its terminal condition.
