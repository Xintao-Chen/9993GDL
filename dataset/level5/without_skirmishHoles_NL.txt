The game is played on an 8 by 8 grid coordinate system with columns and rows indexed from 1 to 8, where each cell is identified by an (x, y) coordinate pair. Certain cells are designated as off-limits at positions (3,3), (3,6), (6,3), and (6,6), and pieces cannot move into these cells. There are two players, white and black, who alternate turns, with white moving first. The initial state places each player’s standard chess pieces on their respective back two rows: white’s pieces occupy rows 1 and 2, black’s pieces occupy rows 7 and 8, arranged in the traditional chess setup with rooks in the corners, knights adjacent, then bishops, followed by queen and king in the center. Each turn, the player in control may perform a move action specifying the starting cell coordinates (x1, y1) and the destination cell coordinates (x2, y2), provided that the piece at the start cell belongs to the player, the move is valid for that piece type, the destination is not off-limits, and the destination cell is not occupied by another piece of the same player. If it is not the player’s turn, the only legal action is a noop, which signifies no operation and effectively passes the turn. Valid moves for each piece type replicate standard chess moves: pawns move forward one or two squares initially (with capture moves diagonally forward by one), knights move in L-shapes, bishops move diagonally, rooks move horizontally or vertically, queens combine rook and bishop moves, and kings move one square in any direction. Pawns promote to queens upon reaching the opponent’s back rank. Moves cannot leap over occupied cells except for knights, and cannot move into off-limits cells. When a piece moves to a cell occupied by an opponent’s piece, that opponent piece is captured and removed from the board, and the moving player’s capture count increases by one. The control of play switches to the other player after each move, and the step counter increments by one each turn. The game ends when a player has no pieces left, has no legal moves available, or when 100 steps have been reached. The scoring is based on the number of captures a player has made, with a predefined mapping translating capture counts to goal scores, ranging from zero for no captures to 100 for sixteen captures. Thus, the player with the higher capture-based goal score at termination is the victor.
