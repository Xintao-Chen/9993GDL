The game is played on an 8-by-8 grid with coordinates ranging from 1 to 8 along both the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) axes, where certain central cells at positions (3,3), (3,6), (6,3), and (6,6) are designated as off-limits and cannot be occupied or moved onto. Two players, White and Black, alternate turns, with White controlling the first move as indicated by initial control. The initial setup is asymmetrical yet balanced, ensuring both sides have the same number of pieces positioned on specific squares: White’s pieces include knights, bishops, rooks, and pawns arranged on the first and second ranks, while Black’s analogous pieces are placed on the seventh and eighth ranks accordingly, respecting the off-limits holes on the board. Each turn, the player in control may perform a move action specifying the starting coordinates and the destination coordinates of a piece they own; moves must be legal according to piece-specific movement rules—pawns can only move by capturing diagonally forward onto opponent-occupied squares and cannot move forward without capturing, while rooks move horizontally or vertically through unobstructed paths, bishops diagonally through unobstructed paths, knights in L-shaped leaps, queens combining rook and bishop moves, and kings moving one square in any direction. Moves are disallowed if they attempt to move onto off-limits cells or onto squares occupied by the player’s own pieces. If it is not a player’s turn, their only legal action is a noop, effectively passing. After a move, the piece relocates from its original cell to the destination cell; if an opposing piece occupied the destination, it is captured and removed from the board, incrementing the moving player’s capture count. Additionally, pawns promote to queens upon reaching the opponent’s back rank (8 for White and 1 for Black). Control alternates between players each turn, and a step counter increments to track the number of turns played, with a maximum of 60 steps allowed. The game ends (terminal condition) if a player has no remaining pieces, has no legal moves left, or when the step count reaches 60. The score for each player is determined by their capture count, mapped to a numeric goal value with higher captures yielding higher scores, where zero captures yield zero points and ten or more captures result in a maximum score of 100. The objective is to maximize this score by capturing opponent pieces. Implicit constraints include staying within the 8x8 board boundaries, avoiding off-limits cells, and respecting occupancy rules that prevent moving onto one’s own pieces. The game proceeds until a terminal condition is met, at which point the player’s scores reflect their effectiveness in capturing opponent pieces throughout the skirmish.
