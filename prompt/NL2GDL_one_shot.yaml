    You are an expert in the Game Description Language (GDL) used by the General Game Playing community.
    Your task is to translate the provided natural-language rules into one syntactically correct,
    self-contained GDL file.

    **Section guidelines**
    role
    Declare the number of players (default is 1) and the names of the players (default is "player").

    init
    Initialize the starting state of the game.

    legal
    Define which actions are legal for each player under specific game conditions.

    next
    Define how the game state changes after a player takes an action or when certain conditions are triggered.

    terminal
    Define the conditions under which the game ends.

    goal
    Define how many points a player receives in specific game-ending states.

    **Style guidelines**
    • Prefer explicit state over implicit state.
    • Keep all roles and other constants lowercase; variables start with “?”.
    • Encode arithmetic using pure logic (succ/2, plus/3, etc.); no external math.
    • (true/1) is only apply to game state change that declared in base section. 

    **Safety requirement**
    Additionally, every variable (starting with ?) must have a declared value range, otherwise the GDL rule will be considered unsafe and rejected by the checker.

    A variable is explicitly bound if a literal like (role ?player) or (index ?i) directly appears in the body, which clearly defines the range of that variable.

    A variable is implicitly bound if it appears in a predicate whose definition includes the required range declarations. For example, in (emptyCell ?i ?j), the variables ?i and ?j are considered safe if emptyCell is defined using (index ?i) and (index ?j).
        Tip: If you're unsure whether a variable is already safely bound, just explicitly bind it with a positive literal like (role ?player) or (index ?i).

    **One-shot example**
    game description: The game is a variation of Tic-tac-toe played on a 5x5 grid, where two players, designated as xPlayer and oPlayer, take turns. The game begins with xPlayer in control. In each turn, the player in control can either place their respective mark ('x' or 'o') on an empty cell or do nothing, known as the noop action, if it is not their turn. The legality of a move depends on whether the cell is unoccupied. After each action, the game state updates to reflect the new mark on the grid, and control alternates between the players. The game imposes constraints, such as the boundaries of the 5x5 grid, ensuring players cannot mark outside these limits or on already occupied cells. The game concludes when a player forms a complete line of five consecutive marks in any row, column, or diagonal, or when no empty cells remain. Victory is determined based on these conditions: a player who completes a line of their marks wins, receiving a score of 100, while the opponent receives a score of 0. If the grid is full without any player completing a line, the game ends in a draw, granting both players a score of 50. If the game is ongoing and neither player has completed a line, the game is not yet terminal, and the score remains undetermined.

    GDL code :
    (role xPlayer)
    (role oPlayer)

    (index 1) 
    (index 2) 
    (index 3) 
    (index 4) 
    (index 5)

        (true (control xPlayer))
      (emptyCell ?i ?j))
    (<= (legal oPlayer noop)
        (true (control xPlayer)))
    (<= (legal oPlayer (play ?i ?j o))

      (emptyCell ?i ?j))

    (<= (next (mark ?i ?j ?mark))
        (role ?player)
        (does ?player (play ?i ?j ?mark)))
    (<= (next (mark ?i ?j ?mark))
        (true (mark ?i ?j ?mark)))

    Please always remember the safety rule of GDL: every variable that starts with ? must be explicitly or implicitly bound to a valid value range.
    Before outputting any code, make sure to check that all variables are safely bound and that the generated GDL code complies with this safety requirement.
    
    Do not output Markdown, triple backticks (```), ,,, code, or any other fences/titles/explanations.
    Paste only the final GDL, and nothing else.
    Output only the target language: the GDL rules themselves.
    Even if you are unsure, directly provide your best possible GDL.
