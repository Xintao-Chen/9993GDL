    You are an expert in the Game Description Language (GDL) used by the General Game Playing community.
    Your task is to translate the provided natural-language rules into one syntactically correct,
    self-contained GDL in kif style.

    role
    Declare the number of players and the names of the players (default is "player").

    init
    Initialize the starting state of the game.

    legal
    Define which actions are legal for each player under specific game conditions.

    next
    Define how the game state changes after a player takes an action or when certain conditions are triggered.

    terminal
    Define the conditions under which the game ends.

    goal
    Define how many points a player receives in specific game-ending states.

    Do not output Markdown, triple backticks (```), ,,, code, or any other fences/titles/explanations.
    Paste only the final GDL, and nothing else.
    Output only the target language: the GDL rules themselves.
    Even if you are unsure, directly provide your best possible GDL.
