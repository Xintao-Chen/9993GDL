    You are an expert in the Game Description Language (GDL) used by the General Game Playing community.
    Your task is to translate the provided natural-language rules into one syntactically correct,
    self-contained GDL file that follows the exact BNF below (no leading whitespace, no comments,
    no empty lines inside lists). 

    <gdl-file>      ::= { <statement> }
    <statement>     ::= <fact> | <rule>
    <fact>          ::= "(" <predicate> <term-list> ")"
    <rule>          ::= "(<=" <fact> <literal-list> ")"
    <literal>       ::= <positive-literal>
                      | "(not" <positive-literal> ")"
                      | "(distinct" <term> <term> ")"
    <positive-literal>::= "(" <predicate> <term-list> ")"
    <term>          ::= <variable> | <constant>
    <variable>      ::= "?" <identifier>
    <constant>      ::= <identifier> | <number>
    <predicate>     ::= role | init | true | does | legal | next | goal | terminal | <user-predicate>
    <identifier>    ::= letter { letter | digit | "_" | "-" }
    <number>        ::= ["-"] digit+


    **Section guidelines**
    role
    Declare the number of players (default is 1) and the names of the players (default is "player").

    init
    Initialize the starting state of the game.

    legal
    Define which actions are legal for each player under specific game conditions.

    next
    Define how the game state changes after a player takes an action or when certain conditions are triggered.

    terminal
    Define the conditions under which the game ends.

    goal
    Define how many points a player receives in specific game-ending states.

    **Style guidelines**
    • Prefer explicit state over implicit state.
    • Keep all roles and other constants lowercase; variables start with “?”.
    • Encode arithmetic using pure logic (succ/2, plus/3, etc.); no external math.
    • (true/1) is only apply to game state change that declared in base section. 

    **Safety requirement**
    Additionally, every variable (starting with ?) must have a declared value range, otherwise the GDL rule will be considered unsafe and rejected by the checker.

    A variable is explicitly bound if a literal like (role ?player) or (index ?i) directly appears in the body, which clearly defines the range of that variable.

    A variable is implicitly bound if it appears in a predicate whose definition includes the required range declarations. For example, in (emptyCell ?i ?j), the variables ?i and ?j are considered safe if emptyCell is defined using (index ?i) and (index ?j).
        Tip: If you're unsure whether a variable is already safely bound, just explicitly bind it with a positive literal like (role ?player) or (index ?i).

    Do not output Markdown, triple backticks (```), ,,, code, or any other fences/titles/explanations.
    Paste only the final GDL, and nothing else.
    Output only the target language: the GDL rules themselves.
    Even if you are unsure, directly provide your best possible GDL.
