If a player opts to finish, the game ends immediately, and the respective player receives the payoff associated with that decision.

Conversely, when Black continues, only Black's payoff increases by the next value in the sequence.

This setup excludes the possibility of solving the puzzle on 2x2 or 3x3 boards. The game is played by a single player, referred to as \"robot,\" who takes turns placing each queen on the board. The game begins with all cells on the board being empty, and the player is tasked with placing the first queen. During each turn, the player places a queen on any cell that is currently blank, following the rule that a move is only legal if the cell is unoccupied. Once a queen is placed, the cell's state changes from blank to occupied by a queen, while other cells remain unchanged. The game continues until there are no more queens left to place, which marks the end of the game. Implicit constraints include board boundaries and ensuring that no two queens can attack each other, meaning they cannot share the same row, column, or diagonal. The game's scoring system awards a score of 0 if any queen is under attack and 100 if all queens are placed without threat. The logic determining whether a cell is attacked checks for the presence of queens in the same row, column, or diagonals defined by consistent sums or differences of row and column indices. The puzzle's constraints are defined by a successor relation, which determines the sequence of numbers relevant to the board's size and extends beyond the board's boundaries to facilitate calculations involving diagonal attacks.

The game reaches a terminal state when either player achieves this, or when there are no open positions left on the board. If xplayer creates a line of three 'X's, they achieve a score of 100, while oplayer receives 0, and vice versa if oplayer forms a line of 'O's. In the event of a draw—where no player forms a line and no spaces remain unmarked—both players receive a score of 50. The game is a classic zero-sum game where the victory conditions are clearly defined by these scoring rules and the terminal conditions ensure a conclusive end to each match."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The game concludes under certain terminal conditions: if a player successfully marks three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or if the board is fully occupied without any player achieving such a line. Scoring is determined by these outcomes: a player who creates a line of their symbols scores 100 points and wins, while their opponent scores 0. If the board fills up without any player completing a line, the game ends in a draw, awarding both players 50 points.

The game features two players, the xplayer and the oplayer, who take turns alternately starting with the xplayer. Players mark these locations on the grid during their turns. The game's turn control mechanism ensures that only the player currently in control can make a move, with the control alternating between the xplayer and oplayer. If a player cannot make a legal move, they may perform a noop, effectively passing their turn. Each action a player takes involves marking a blank cell, and the legality of this action is contingent on the cell being unoccupied and the player having control. If both players choose to mark the same spot during their respective turns, the resulting state depends on the control at the time, with each player potentially able to override the other under specific conditions. The game imposes implicit constraints such as board boundaries, ensuring players cannot mark outside the designated grid locations, and occupancy conflicts, preventing a cell from being marked more than once unless both players attempt to mark it simultaneously. The game ends when one player forms a line of three consecutive marks in any direction, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when there are no blank spaces left on the board. Scoring is determined by victory criteria where a player achieves a full line of their marks, granting them a score of 100, while a draw, with no lines completed and no spaces remaining, results in both players receiving a score of 50.

The player assumes the role of \"taker\" and takes turns to either remove a green disk or reset the board. The initial state of the game is defined with these specific disk placements and a reset state labeled s0. Players interact with the game via legal actions, which include removing a disk from a position if it is green, or resetting the board to its initial state. The 'noop' mechanism allows the player to pass their turn without any action. The legal actions trigger state changes whereby a removed green disk results in that position becoming empty, and the removal of a disk can affect adjacent positions, potentially changing the color of adjacent disks. Adjacent relationships are specified, such as between p1 and p2 or p7 and p8, creating implicit constraints on how actions impact the board.

The robot can choose from a set of actions labeled a, b, c, or d, depending on its current position, with specific legal actions available at particular states. For instance, actions a and b are allowed when the game state is h1. The robot progresses from one state to another based on these actions, triggering automatic state changes, such as moving from h1 to h2 when action a is executed, or from h5 to h6 when action a is executed from h5. The game incorporates a noop mechanism, meaning the robot can opt to do nothing if no legal move is available, although this is not explicitly detailed in the game's progression. The game's actions must respect implicit constraints, such as the boundaries of the board, which are defined by the positions h1 through h8, and ensure no conflicting occupancy occurs within these positions.

Scoring in the game is straightforward: the robot scores 100 points upon reaching position h3, which is one of the victory conditions, while any other outcome results in a score of zero.

The game begins with the robot positioned at depth level1 and a previous goal value set to zero. The player controls the robot by selecting a move direction from the available options—c1, c2, c3, or c4—during each turn. The legal moves are defined by these directions, and the player must choose one direction per turn. The game employs a mechanism to maintain the robot's previous choices, ensuring continuity in the game's state across turns. As the game progresses, the depth level is incremented, moving from level1 to level2 and so on, up to level5. Each action the robot undertakes may trigger changes in the state, such as updating choice points or setting a new previous goal if one is defined by the current state goal. The game also has implicit constraints, such as boundaries within the coordinate system and conflicts that arise from certain occupancy conditions, though these are not explicitly stated. Terminal conditions are reached when the depth level advances to level5, marking the end of the game. The robot's objective is to achieve various state goals that grant scores of 25, 50, 75, or 100 points, depending on satisfying specific criteria related to the robot's choices at different depth levels. These criteria involve combinations of moves that must be made or avoided.

The game starts with numbers 1 through 9 available for selection, and control initially assigned to 'white'. Players take turns selecting numbers, with the action 'take' being the primary move, where a player can take any available number. The legality of a move is contingent upon the number being available and the player having control; otherwise, a 'noop' action is applied, where a player effectively passes their turn. The state changes dynamically as numbers are taken; once a number is taken by a player, it is no longer available, and control of the turn switches to the other player. Implicit constraints within the game include the availability of numbers and the control of turn order, with no two players selecting the same number. The game concludes when either a player achieves a 'sum15' condition, where they possess a combination of three numbers that sum to 15, or when no numbers are left available. In terms of scoring and victory conditions, a player wins outright with a score of 100 if they achieve the 'sum15' condition. If neither player achieves this condition and all numbers are taken, the game is a draw, awarding each player a score of 50. If one player achieves a 'sum15', the other player scores 0.

The game begins with the initial state where position pos1 is set to a and position pos2 is set to x.

The robot can either move forward through these actions or decide to do nothing, a situation managed by what is termed the noop mechanism, where the state does not change if no action is taken. Each action has a straightforward format, being a simple choice among the available legal actions, and is considered legal as long as the robot selects from these given options.
