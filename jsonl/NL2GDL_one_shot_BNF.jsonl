The player takes on the role of a robot and is the sole participant, executing actions in a sequential manner without any competition from other players. Initially, all cells in the grid are set to a value of 0, and the game begins with a counter initialized at 1. The player can choose to perform a \"press\" action on any grid cell with coordinates that fall within the defined x and y ranges. The legality of an action is determined by the cell coordinates being within these specified bounds. When the robot presses a cell, the state of that cell changes to 4 in the next turn. This triggers a cascading effect where cells decrement their values each turn, transitioning from 4 to 3, 3 to 2, 2 to 1, and 1 back to 0, while cells already at 0 remain unchanged. The counter increments with each action, and as the game progresses, certain conditions can trigger the \"lightson\" states, which are dependent on specific patterns of activated cells. The game reaches a terminal state when either the \"lightson\" state reaches 9 or the counter hits 21, signifying the end of the game. To achieve victory, the player must successfully activate a \"lightson\" state of 9, which grants a score of 100, while failing to do so results in a score of 0.

The game begins with a fire already initiated and the step counter set at one, marking the initial state. The player, acting as the firefighter, can perform several actions, which include moving in any compass direction such as north, south, east, west, and their respective diagonals, as well as executing specific actions like extinguishing the fire or choosing to flee. The game employs a turn-based system where the firefighter decides their move each step, with the option to perform a noop or no operation, essentially passing the turn if no legal move is chosen. For an action to be legal, it must be within the defined set of possibilities, such as walking in a specified direction or extinguishing. Each action taken by the firefighter triggers changes in the game state, advancing the step counter and potentially altering conditions like marking the action as completed or even causing the firefighter to lose if inappropriate moves are made, such as walking into a lost condition. Implicit constraints include the boundaries of the board, which the firefighter must navigate without exceeding, and managing the fire's proximity to avoid occupancy conflicts. The game reaches its terminal state when the step counter hits fifty or if the firefighter chooses to flee. Scoring is straightforward: the firefighter earns 100 points if the game concludes without loss or fleeing, scores 20 points if they flee, and receives zero points if they lose. The game's progression is meticulously structured through a series of successor relations, ensuring the continuity from one step to the next, ultimately guiding the player through the intricate decisions of firefighting."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The players in this game are assigned the roles of black and white, with black always making the first move. The initial state of the game assigns control to the black player. Players alternate turns, and when it's not a player's turn, they can legally perform a 'noop' action, meaning they do nothing. On a player's turn, they can place a piece on any empty cell, defined as a cell that is indexed but not occupied by a piece. Once a player places their piece on an empty cell, the action results in a state change where the cell becomes occupied by that player's color. The game automatically switches control to the other player after a move. The game is bound by implicit constraints such as board boundaries, ensuring that pieces cannot be placed outside the 11x11 grid, and occupancy conflicts, which prevent placing a piece on an already occupied cell. The game reaches a terminal state when there are no empty cells left on the board or when a player successfully forms a line of exactly five consecutive pieces, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The initial state of the game grants control to the player with the black pieces, establishing the order of play as black first, followed by white. A player's turn involves placing a piece at an empty coordinate on the board, and this action is only legal if the player currently has control and the chosen cell is unoccupied. If a player does not have control, they can perform a noop, essentially passing their turn. The game alternates control between players after each valid move. The board's boundaries are implicitly constrained by the coordinate indices ranging from 1 to 15, ensuring that no move can be made outside this grid. A move triggers state changes by marking the chosen cell with the player's color, and this new state persists into subsequent turns. A terminal condition is reached either when all cells are occupied or when a player successfully forms a line of exactly five consecutive pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The victory criteria grant a score of 100 to the player who forms such a line, while their opponent scores 0. If the board is completely filled without any player forming a line of five, the game ends in a draw, with both players receiving a score of 50. The game acknowledges potential bias towards the black player, but the rules remain impartial in terms of turn-based mechanics and winning conditions."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

There are two player roles: the \"guesser\" and the \"chooser,\" with the guesser starting the game. Initially, the game begins at step 1, and the guesser is in control with all numbers from 1 to 63 being possible guesses. The guesser makes a guess by choosing a number from the possible set, and the chooser responds with either \"higher,\" \"lower,\" or \"wait,\" depending on whether the guessed number is less than, greater than, or equal to the number they have in mind. If the guesser guesses the correct number, the game ends. The guesser's legal actions depend on the current control, allowing them to guess when in control or wait otherwise. The chooser's legal responses are contingent on the guess and the possible number, with \"higher\" and \"lower\" being options if the guessed number is incorrect. The game progresses by alternating control between the guesser and chooser after each action. Actions trigger state changes, such as updating which numbers remain possible, depending on whether the chooser indicates \"higher\" or \"lower.\" Implicit constraints include maintaining the set of possible numbers, which is narrowed down based on the chooser's feedback, and ensuring numbers guessed are within the defined boundaries. The game becomes terminal when either the guesser correctly guesses the number or when step 12 is reached without a correct guess. Scoring is straightforward: if the game ends with a correct guess, the guesser scores 100 points and the chooser scores 0; if not, the chooser scores 100 points and the guesser scores 0.

State changes occur after each action, updating the positions of discs and the status of whether a disc or pillar is clear. Implicit constraints include ensuring actions respect the boundaries of the board by not allowing moves that place a larger disc on a smaller one or a disc where it cannot physically be due to the game's rules. The game concludes when either the player successfully builds a tower of all six discs on pillar3, the player gives up, or 64 steps have been completed. Victory is achieved by constructing a tower on pillar3, resulting in a score of 100 for the player, whereas giving up results in a score of 5, and failing to build the tower within the given turns without giving up results in a score of 0."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The player begins the game with a specific arrangement: disc5 is on pillar1, disc4 is on disc5, disc3 is on disc4, disc2 is on disc3, and disc1 is on disc2. The initial state also includes all discs and pillar2 and pillar3 being clear except for the smallest disc, disc1, and the game begins at step s0. There is only one player role who takes turns, and during each turn, the player can choose to perform a legal action or pass. Legal actions require that both the disc being moved and the target location are clear and that the disc being moved is smaller than the disc or pillar it is placed upon. The game progresses through a series of steps, with each step being a successor of the previous one. When a player moves a disc, it triggers a state change where the disc is placed on another disc or pillar, making the previous location clear. Implicit constraints include the boundaries of the board, where discs must always be placed on a larger disc or a pillar, ensuring no occupancy conflicts occur. The game reaches its terminal condition at step s31, which marks the end of the game. The player's goal is to build a tower on pillar3, with the height of the tower determining the score. If the player constructs a tower of height s5 on pillar3, they achieve the maximum score of 100. Towers of lesser heights on pillar3 result in lower scores, with specific scoring criteria for heights s4, s3, s2, and anything smaller than s2 resulting in a score of zero. The game is essentially a puzzle where the player must strategically move discs to achieve the highest possible score within the given time frame."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The game allows white to perform actions of type s and u, while black can execute move, grab, and drop actions. White's actions are legal if the source and destination are distinct and meet certain occupancy conditions, such as the source being clear and designated as a table. Black's moves are unrestricted in legality, but grabbing requires the presence of gold at the cell, and dropping is contingent on holding gold. Actions lead to various state changes: white's actions can move objects between locations, modifying table and clear states, while black's actions can relocate gold between cells, specifically affecting the gold's position and state of occupancy. Implicit constraints include adjacency between the locations, which restrict movements to neighboring cells, and occupancy conflicts that prevent stacking on an already occupied location unless it's specified as a table and clear. The game reaches a terminal condition either after the second step or when white successfully places objects on a and b, b and c, and black places gold on a. Scoring for white is pegged at 100 points if their objects are correctly stacked in sequence on a, b, and c, while black scores 100 if they manage to place gold on a, with any deviation from these goals resulting in zero points."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

Players take turns in a sequential manner, with the kitten being the only active role. The primary objective is for the kitten to navigate from its starting position to the goal located at (15, 4), avoiding the increasing fire that consumes one column from the left each round. During each turn, the player can choose from a set of legal moves, including up, down, left, or right, as long as the destination is within the board’s boundaries and adjacent to the current position. If a move is made, the kitten's position updates to the new coordinates, and the round counter increases by one. The game incorporates implicit constraints such as boundary limits, preventing the kitten from moving into walls or previously blocked fields. The game concludes under one of three terminal conditions: the kitten reaches the goal, the fire overtakes the kitten's position, or the maximum number of rounds (16) is reached.

At the beginning of the game, white controls the pieces located at coordinates (4, 1), (7, 1), (1, 4), and (10, 4), while black controls the pieces at (1, 7), (10, 7), (4, 10), and (7, 10). The player in control alternates each turn, with white initially holding control, and each player can choose to perform an action or a noop (no operation) if it is not their turn. Each action involves a player moving a piece from its current position to a new location following a knight's move pattern from chess, and optionally shooting an arrow to a second new location, which must also be empty. The legal conditions for actions require that the initial move lands on an empty cell, and any subsequent arrow shot must also land on an empty cell. The grid imposes boundaries, and conflicts arise if a cell is occupied by a player or an arrow, preventing further occupancy. The game reaches a terminal state when one player can no longer make a legal move, resulting in the opposing player achieving victory with a score of 100, while the player unable to move scores zero. This setup implies that players must strategically position their pieces and arrows to block their opponent's potential moves, utilizing the constraints of knight movement and empty cell requirements to their advantage."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

If a player moves to a cell occupied by another player or a hole, they are marked as dead, and their turn becomes a noop. The game progresses with players taking turns in a specific sequence, and each successful move increases the player’s score based on a predefined scoring system. The game ends when all players are dead, and the final scores determine the winner. Players must navigate the board while avoiding collisions and strategically positioning themselves to maximize their score. The implicit constraints include board boundaries that restrict movement to within the 11x11 grid, and a player cannot occupy the same cell as another player or a hole without becoming dead.

The game begins with all cells unlit and the step count at zero. The robot's task is to light up cells across four distinct 2x2 regions within this grid, and it takes turns by executing the “press” action. This action is legal when pressing occurs within specified indices: x1 and y1 must be 1 or 2, while x2 and y2, as well as x3 and y3, must be 3 or 4. The robot can press up to four cells simultaneously, and each press changes the state of the affected cells to 4, indicating they are fully lit. Subsequently, these cells will gradually reduce in value each turn, simulating lights dimming, until they return to zero if not pressed again. Implicit constraints of the game include ensuring actions remain within the grid boundaries and avoiding occupancy conflicts where multiple presses affect the same cell. The game can end in two ways: either when the step count reaches 20 or if all four 2x2 sections of the grid are successfully lit, referred to as lightsOn1, lightsOn2, lightsOn3, and lightsOn4. Winning conditions are met if any of these sections are fully lit, granting the robot a score of 100. Failure to light up any section by the terminal condition results in a score of 0. Through strategic presses and attention to the dimming mechanics, the robot seeks to achieve maximum illumination across the grid within the constraints of the turn limit."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The game involves a single player role, identified as \"robot,\" which takes turns to interact with the grid. The game begins with every cell on the grid initialized to the off state, and the current step is set to 0. The player can issue a \"press\" action with four coordinates, where each coordinate ranges from 1 to 4, corresponding to the grid's dimensions. The legal action involves selecting any two cells on the grid as specified by these coordinates. When a cell is pressed, it transitions to a brighter state from 0 to 4, incrementing one step with each press. The game includes a noop mechanism through which the player can choose not to press any cells, allowing the turn to pass without altering the grid state. The game's implicit constraints ensure that actions are confined within the board's boundaries, and that a cell's state will not exceed 4. The game's primary objective is to achieve a state where all cells in any of the four 2x2 quadrants of the grid are turned on, with each quadrant having its own terminal condition. The game concludes either when one of these quadrants is fully lit or when 20 steps have been reached without achieving this condition. Victory is determined by lighting up any of the quadrants, which earns the robot a score of 100. If none of the quadrants are fully lit by step 20, the robot scores 0.

The legality of a move depends on whether the cell is unoccupied. After each action, the game state updates to reflect the new mark on the grid, and control alternates between the players. The game imposes constraints, such as the boundaries of the 5x5 grid, ensuring players cannot mark outside these limits or on already occupied cells. The game concludes when a player forms a complete line of five consecutive marks in any row, column, or diagonal, or when no empty cells remain. Victory is determined based on these conditions: a player who completes a line of their marks wins, receiving a score of 100, while the opponent receives a score of 0. If the grid is full without any player completing a line, the game ends in a draw, granting both players a score of 50.

Each cell in this grid can be in one of two states: \"light\" or \"nolight.\" Initially, the board is set up such that certain cells are lit and others are not, as specified in the initial configuration. The game involves a single player who takes turns to switch the state of the cells. During each turn, the player can perform a \"switch\" action on a cell at coordinates (x, y) as long as those coordinates are valid, meaning they fall within the 1 to 5 range. This switch action is legal if it targets any cell on the board. Performing a switch affects not only the targeted cell but also its adjacent ones, flipping their states from light to nolight or vice versa. The game progresses through a sequence of steps, starting from step 0, with each step representing a turn. The player may choose to perform an action or opt for a \"noop\" (no operation), effectively passing their turn. The game concludes under two terminal conditions: either when the game reaches step 20 or when there are no cells in the \"light\" state, known as the \"lighton\" condition. The victory condition is based on whether the board has any lights on; if there are no lights on, the player scores 100 points, indicating a win, otherwise, they score 0 points. The game mechanics implicitly enforce several constraints, such as board boundaries, meaning actions are only applicable within the defined grid, and the effects of an action are limited by adjacency, affecting only neighboring cells. The player's objective is to strategically switch the cells to achieve the desired end state within the given number of steps."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The player takes on the role of the \"robot,\" who is the sole participant and thus operates independently, taking turns in a sequential and unopposed manner. The game begins with the robot positioned at location 'a,' while a piece of gold is initially placed at location 'c.' The game tracks progression through a step counter that starts at 1. During each turn, the robot can perform one of three actions: move, grab, or drop. The move action is only legal if the robot's current position is adjacent to the target position, aligning with the predefined adjacency rules. The robot can grab the gold if it is on the same cell as the gold, and it can drop the gold at its current position only if it is carrying the gold, denoted by the gold being held at a special location 'i.' Legal actions are determined by the current game state, and if no legal action is possible, a \"noop\" or no-operation action can occur, essentially passing the turn. When a move is executed, the robot advances to an adjacent cell, and if a grab occurs, the gold moves with the robot or stays put if it's not picked up. Dropping the gold places it at the robot's current location. Implicit constraints include respecting board boundaries and adjacency relationships, ensuring the robot cannot move to non-adjacent cells or occupy the same space as the gold unless picking it up. The game reaches a terminal state either when the step counter reaches 10 or if the gold is successfully moved to location 'a.'

Two players take turns, with roles designated as \"odd\" and \"even.\" The player with the role \"odd\" starts the game, controlling the grid initially. Players alternate turns throughout the game. The game involves marking the grid cells with numbers corresponding to the player's role, with \"odd\" marking odd numbers and \"even\" marking even numbers. A player can only mark a cell if it is blank and if they control the turn. The action to mark a cell is represented as (mark ?m ?n ?x), where ?m and ?n are the coordinates, and ?x is the player's number. The game also includes a \"noop\" action, which allows a player to pass their turn if no legal moves are available. State changes occur when a player marks a cell, with the control of the game switching to the other player after each turn. Implicit constraints include ensuring that numbers are placed in blank cells and that players can only use their allocated numbers. The game ends when a \"line\" is formed, which can be a row, column, or diagonal where the sum of the numbers matches certain predefined conditions, or when there are no open cells left on the grid.

The game begins in the initial state of p1, and the player, referred to as the robot, takes sequential turns. During a turn, the player can choose one of three possible actions: a, b, or c, depending on the current state. The noop mechanism, which implies doing nothing, is not explicitly present but can be inferred as an illegal move unless the robot is in a state where no actions are available. The format of each action is simple, where the robot selects an action that is deemed legal based on the current state. For instance, the robot can perform action a when in states p1, p2, p5, p6, p9, p10, p13, or p14, action b when in states p1, p3, p5, p7, p9, p11, p13, or p15, and action c when in states p4, p8, or p12. Once an action is executed, it triggers a state change, advancing the game to the next sequential state, such as moving from p1 to p2 when executing action a. The board boundaries are implicitly defined by the sequence of states from p1 to p16, with state p16 acting as the terminal condition. The game concludes when the robot reaches state p16, at which point the robot scores 90 points, signifying victory. If the game ends without reaching p16, the robot scores 0 points, indicating a loss. There are no distance relationships or occupancy conflicts as the game progresses in a straightforward linear fashion, with each state allowing specific actions that lead to the next state in the sequence."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The game's state evolves as cells with a value of 4 decrease their value down to 0 through intermediate states in subsequent turns, simulating a light dimming process. Implicit constraints include the boundaries of the board, meaning the robot cannot press outside the 4x4 grid, and there are no occupancy conflicts as each cell operates independently. The game reaches a terminal state when specific groups of lights, defined as lightson12, lightson13, lightson14, lightson23, lightson24, or lightson34, are all turned on simultaneously. These groups represent various combinations of cells where the lights must be on to satisfy the condition. The victory criterion is met when any of these group conditions are satisfied, awarding the robot a score of 100. If none of these conditions are met by the end of the game, the score remains 0."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The game begins in an initial state where the round is set to 1, and each player starts with a score of zero. During each turn, a player may perform the action of selecting a number from a predefined set ranging from 1 to 10, with the condition that the action is legal if the player is a recognized participant and the selected number is within the allowed range. The game's progression is governed by transition rules where, after each round, the round number increments, and scores may change depending on the selections. If two players select the same number, no score changes occur for that number. However, if a player selects a number greater than another player's unique selection, the former player does not score. Conversely, if a player's selection is unique and not smaller than any other player's unique selection, they earn an additional ten points. The game concludes when either 25 rounds have been completed or a player reaches a score of 100 points. The winner is determined based on the final scores, with each player's score reflecting their performance throughout the game.

There is only one player role, termed \"snake,\" which takes turns in a sequential manner. Initially, the game begins with a step count of zero and the snake occupying cells (1, 1) and (2, 1) on the grid. Players control the snake's movement by issuing commands to move up, down, left, or right. These commands are legal only when the snake's head is not at the boundary of the grid in the direction of movement. The game employs a \"noop\" mechanism where no move is made if none are legal, thus preserving the state. Actions lead to state changes where the snake moves forward, and body parts shift accordingly unless a collision occurs. Implicit constraints include the grid boundaries, which prevent movement outside the defined coordinates, and occupancy conflicts where the snake cannot move into a cell already occupied by its body. The game reaches a terminal state either when a collision occurs or when the step count reaches 20. Scoring is based on achieving a goal of 100 points, which is awarded when a snake completely fills a grid index, meaning no open cells remain. If both grids have open cells, the player scores zero. This setup ensures a strategic challenge where maintaining control of the snake's movement and avoiding collisions are crucial for success."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

Each action the robot undertakes may trigger changes in the state, such as updating choice points or setting a new previous goal if one is defined by the current state goal. The game also has implicit constraints, such as boundaries within the coordinate system and conflicts that arise from certain occupancy conditions, though these are not explicitly stated. Terminal conditions are reached when the depth level advances to level5, marking the end of the game. The robot's objective is to achieve various state goals that grant scores of 25, 50, 75, or 100 points, depending on satisfying specific criteria related to the robot's choices at different depth levels. These criteria involve combinations of moves that must be made or avoided. The scoring system is pivotal to the victory criteria, with the robot's ultimate aim being to accumulate the highest score possible by the game's conclusion."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The game starts with numbers 1 through 9 available for selection, and control initially assigned to 'white'. Players take turns selecting numbers, with the action 'take' being the primary move, where a player can take any available number. The legality of a move is contingent upon the number being available and the player having control; otherwise, a 'noop' action is applied, where a player effectively passes their turn. The state changes dynamically as numbers are taken; once a number is taken by a player, it is no longer available, and control of the turn switches to the other player. Implicit constraints within the game include the availability of numbers and the control of turn order, with no two players selecting the same number. The game concludes when either a player achieves a 'sum15' condition, where they possess a combination of three numbers that sum to 15, or when no numbers are left available. In terms of scoring and victory conditions, a player wins outright with a score of 100 if they achieve the 'sum15' condition. If neither player achieves this condition and all numbers are taken, the game is a draw, awarding each player a score of 50. If one player achieves a 'sum15', the other player scores 0. The game thus revolves around strategic number selection and blocking the opponent from completing a winning sum."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

Legal actions trigger state changes: performing action 'a' by red transitions 'off' to 'on', while 'b' reverts 'on' back to 'off'; white's 'c' changes 'red' to 'green', and 'd' changes 'green' back to 'red'; blue's 'e' shifts 'dim' to 'bright', and 'f' reverts 'bright' to 'dim'. Implicit constraints include the fact that certain states cannot coexist, as actions are designed to toggle states between two possibilities. The game reaches its terminal condition when the state 'end' is achieved, transitioning automatically from 'start'. Scoring criteria are based on the final states: red scores 100 if 'on' is true, otherwise 0; white scores 100 if 'green' is true, otherwise 0; blue scores 100 if 'bright' is true, otherwise 0. The player with the highest score at the end of the game is declared the winner. The game emphasizes strategic choices based on state transitions and the timing of actions to maximize scores and reach the terminal state."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The player takes on the singular role of navigating these subgames, specifically moving between positions in two separate graphs: graph 1 involves a sequence of positions a, b, and c, while graph 2 consists of x, y, and z. The game begins with the initial state where position pos1 is set to a and position pos2 is set to x. During each turn, the player can perform one of two actions: move1 or move2, each associated with a target position. The move1 action is legal if the current position in pos1 is connected to the target position via conn1, and similarly, move2 is legal if the current position in pos2 is connected to the target position via conn2. State changes are triggered by these actions, resulting in the updating of the positions pos1 and pos2 as per the executed move. The game applies implicit constraints such as ensuring movements respect the boundaries of the graphs and maintaining the integrity of the defined connections. The game reaches a terminal condition when specific combinations of positions are achieved, such as pos1 being c and pos2 being z, or other specified end states. The player scores a victory with a goal score of 100 if they successfully navigate pos1 to c and pos2 to z, while any deviation from achieving both these end positions results in a score of 0. The design of the game highlights the complexity in planning, as even though the subgames have straightforward local plans, combining them into a global strategy is non-trivial."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The game's initial state positions the player at point a on the first graph and at point x on the second graph. The player takes turns to make moves, with the option to perform either a \"move1\" or \"move2\" action, depending on their current position. For a \"move1\" action to be legal, the player must be at a position on the first graph with a direct connection to the desired destination.

If the game is ongoing and neither player has completed a line, the game is not yet terminal, and the score remains undetermined.\n\nGDL code :\n(role xPlayer)\n(role oPlayer)\n\n(index 1) \n(index 2) \n(index 3) \n(index 4) \n(index 5)\n\n(init (control xPlayer))\n\n(<= (legal xPlayer noop)\n    (true (control oPlayer)))\n(<= (legal xPlayer (play ?i ?j x))\n    (true (control xPlayer))\n  (emptyCell ?i ?j))\n(<= (legal oPlayer noop)\n    (true (control xPlayer)))\n(<= (legal oPlayer (play ?i ?j o))\n    (true (control oPlayer))\n  (emptyCell ?i ?j))\n\n(<= (next (mark ?i ?j ?mark))\n    (role ?player)\n    (does ?player (play ?i ?j ?mark)))\n(<= (next (mark ?i ?j ?mark))\n    (true (mark ?i ?j ?mark)))\n(<= (next (control xPlayer))\n    (true (control oPlayer)))\n(<= (next (control oPlayer))\n    (true (control xPlayer)))\n\n(<= terminal\n    (line x))\n(<= terminal\n    (line o))\n(<= terminal\n    (not open))\n\n(<= (goal xPlayer 100)\n    (line x))\n(<= (goal xPlayer 50)\n    (not (line x))\n    (not (line o))\n    (not open))\n(<= (goal xPlayer 0)\n    (line o))\n(<= (goal xPlayer 0)\n    (not (line x))\n    (not (line o))\n    open)\n(<= (goal oPlayer 100)\n    (line o))\n(<= (goal oPlayer 50)\n    (not (line x))\n    (not (line o))\n    (not open))\n(<= (goal oPlayer 0)\n    (line x))\n(<= (goal oPlayer 0)\n    (not (line x))\n    (not (line o))\n    open)\n\n(<= (row ?i ?mark)\n    (true (mark ?i 1 ?mark))\n    (true (mark ?i 2 ?mark))\n    (true (mark ?i 3 ?mark))\n    (true (mark ?i 4 ?mark))\n    (true (mark ?i 5 ?mark)))\n(<= (col ?j ?mark)\n    (true (mark 1 ?j ?mark))\n    (true (mark 2 ?j ?mark))\n    (true (mark 3 ?j ?mark))\n    (true (mark 4 ?j ?mark))\n    (true (mark 5 ?j ?mark)))\n(<= (diag ?mark)\n    (true (mark 1 1 ?mark))\n    (true (mark 2 2 ?mark))\n    (true (mark 3 3 ?mark))\n    (true (mark 4 4 ?mark))\n    (true (mark 5 5 ?mark)))\n(<= (diag ?mark)\n    (true (mark 1 5 ?mark))\n    (true (mark 2 4 ?mark))\n    (true (mark 3 3 ?mark))\n    (true (mark 4 2 ?mark))\n    (true (mark 5 1 ?mark)))\n\n(<= (line ?mark)\n    (index ?i)\n    (row ?i ?mark))\n(<= (line ?mark)\n    (index ?j)\n    (col ?j ?mark))\n(<= (line ?mark)    \n    (diag ?mark))\n    \n(<= (emptyCell ?i ?j)\n    (index ?i)\n    (index ?j)\n    (not (true (mark ?i ?j x)))\n    (not (true (mark ?i ?j o))))\n(<= open    \n    (emptyCell ?i ?j))\n\nPlease always remember the safety rule of GDL: every variable that starts with ? must be explicitly or implicitly bound to a valid value range.\nBefore outputting any code, make sure to check that all variables are safely bound and that the generated GDL code complies with this safety requirement.\n\nDo not output Markdown, triple backticks (```), ,,, code, or any other fences/titles/explanations.\nPaste only the final GDL, and nothing else.\nOutput only the target language: the GDL rules themselves.\nEven if you are unsure, directly provide your best possible GDL.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "In the game \"Untwisty Corridor,\" the environment features a linear progression system where a single player, the robot, navigates through a series of states. The game begins with the robot in the initial state labeled q1, and the step count set to 1. The robot alone takes turns, and each turn involves selecting one of the legal actions, denoted by letters a through h. The robot can either move forward through these actions or decide to do nothing, a situation managed by what is termed the noop mechanism, where the state does not change if no action is taken. Each action has a straightforward format, being a simple choice among the available legal actions, and is considered legal as long as the robot selects from these given options. The state transitions depend on the robot's chosen action; performing actions a through g keeps the robot in states q1 or p, while action h, when used in specific conditions such as when p is not true, allows progression through states q2 to q8. Implicit constraints in the game include the necessity of following the succession of steps, as defined from 1 to 8, and the requirement that conditions must be met to advance states, particularly with action h. The game reaches a terminal condition when the step count reaches 8, marking the end of the game. The scoring system is binary; the robot achieves victory and scores 100 if it successfully reaches state q8, otherwise, it scores 0. The boundaries are defined by the succession order and the linear nature of the state progression, with no complex spatial or occupancy constraints, focusing instead on a sequence of correct actions to reach the desired terminal state."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}
