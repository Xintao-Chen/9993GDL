In the initial state, the control is given to the Red player. Each player, when it is their turn, can legally perform one of two actions: they can choose to drop a disc into an open column, or they can opt to perform a noop action, which signifies passing their turn if they are not in control. The legality of dropping a disc depends on whether the column is open, meaning there is at least one empty cell in that column. When a player drops a disc in a column, it occupies the lowest available cell, and control is then transferred to the next player in the sequence. The game progresses with Red followed by Yellow, then Blue. Implicit constraints include the board's boundaries, ensuring discs are only placed within the grid, and avoiding occupancy conflicts by checking if a cell is already occupied. The game reaches a terminal condition when a player forms a line of four consecutive discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or if there are no open spaces left on the board. The scoring system assigns 100 points to a player who successfully forms a line, 50 points to an assisting player when their assisted player forms a line, and 0 points to players when neither condition is met or when a player has assisted another player who wins. The assists are predefined relationships where Red assists Yellow, Yellow assists Blue, and Blue assists Red, adding a layer of strategic alliances to the gameplay."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

There are two players, each assuming a distinct role: the \"crosser\" and the \"blocker\". The turns are structured such that both players alternate in taking actions. Initially, every cell on the board is marked as empty, denoted by 'b'. During their turn, each player can choose to take a specific action, which involves marking a cell. The crosser aims to mark a sequence of connected cells across the board from the first column to the fourth, while the blocker aims to prevent this. The noop mechanism is in place, meaning that if a player cannot make a legal move, they effectively do nothing that turn. An action is formatted as the player marking a specific cell, and for it to be legal, the targeted cell must be empty and the player must be eligible to make a move. When a crosser marks a cell, it becomes a crosser cell, unless the blocker has already marked it. Conversely, a blocker can only mark an empty cell. The board maintains implicit constraints such as boundary limits of the grid, preventing any moves outside the 1 to 4 index range, and ensures no cell can be occupied by both players simultaneously. The game reaches a terminal state if the crosser successfully creates a continuous path from the left to the right of the board, or if there are no empty cells remaining. In terms of scoring, if the crosser creates a path, they score 100 points and the blocker scores 0. If the game ends without a path and no empty cells are left, the blocker scores 100 points and the crosser scores 0.

Two players, referred to as 'red' and 'black,' take turns to drop their respective colored discs into the columns, with the initial player being 'red'. The game begins with 'red' in control, and players alternate turns, marked by the transition of control from one to the other. If a player does not have control, they execute a 'noop' action, essentially passing the turn. Each move consists of a 'drop' action in a column, which is only legal if the column is open. The game enforces implicit constraints such as ensuring a disc cannot be placed outside the board's boundaries, and a column is considered open only if its topmost cell is unoccupied. Upon dropping a disc, it automatically occupies the lowest available cell in the chosen column. The game reaches a terminal state when a player forms a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs, or when the board is completely filled with no open columns.

Two players, designated as \"red\" and \"black,\" alternately take turns, with the red player always starting first. The initial state of the game is determined by the player in control, which at the beginning is red. Turn control involves a mechanism known as \"noop,\" where a player does nothing while the other player is in control, ensuring smooth alternation between players. Legal actions for each player consist of dropping a piece into one of the board's columns, but only if the column is open, meaning it is not full. The format of an action is specified as a drop into a specific column, such as (drop ?x), where ?x represents the column number. Upon executing a drop action, the game state changes as the piece occupies the lowest available cell in the specified column, with automatic events managing the alternate control of the game between players. Constraints within the game include the boundaries of the board, ensuring that pieces cannot be placed outside the designated columns and rows, and avoiding occupancy conflicts by only allowing pieces to be placed in open cells. The game concludes when a player forms a line of four consecutive pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when the board is completely filled, leaving no open columns. Scoring criteria dictate that if a player achieves a line of four, they score 100 points, and if neither player forms a line and the board is full, both players score 50 points.

The game reaches a terminal state when a player successfully completes a row, column, or diagonal with their marker, or when there are no empty cells left. Scoring is based on these terminal conditions: if black completes a line with 'x', they score 100 points, while white scores 0. Conversely, if white completes a line with 'o', they score 100 points, and black scores 0.

The game begins with White in control and possessing an initial payoff of 5, while Black starts with a payoff of 0. At each turn, the player in control can choose to either \"finish\" the game or \"continue\". If a player opts to finish, the game ends immediately, and the respective player receives the payoff associated with that decision. If a player chooses to continue, the control switches to the other player, and the payoff amounts adjust according to a predefined succession of values. Specifically, when White continues, the payoff for both players can increase according to a sequence: White's payoff advances by increments defined in the \"succ\" relations, while Black's payoff advances by larger increments in the same sequence. Conversely, when Black continues, only Black's payoff increases by the next value in the sequence. The \"noop\" mechanism allows a player to have no legal moves when it is not their turn, maintaining the turn order. The game is played across multiple rounds, with White having the first and last decisions at moves 1 and 17 respectively, and Black making the final decision at move 18. The implicit constraint is that players must adhere to the alternating control and decision sequence, effectively being locked into this turn-based system without spatial or occupancy conflicts. The game can also automatically conclude if Black's payoff reaches 95, regardless of player decisions. The terminal condition is triggered either by the choice to finish or by reaching the maximum payoff sequence. Upon termination, each player’s score is directly determined by their respective payoffs at the end of the game, if the game ends without a decision to finish, both players receive a score of 0. The rational strategy, as suggested by conventional game theory, is for players to finish the game at the earliest opportunity to maximize their individual payoffs, with White logically choosing to finish on the first move to secure 5 points, based on the anticipation of Black’s future decisions."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

Additionally, a player may choose to take no action during their turn, represented by the noop mechanism, which means they pass control to their opponent. Each player's action must adhere to certain conditions; for instance, laying claim to the prize requires that the player is currently in control and has at least one point to spend. When a player lays claim, their score decreases by one point, whereas if they end the game, the player who last laid claim receives an additional five points to their score. The game continues with alternating turns until a player decides to end it, at which point the game's terminal condition is met. The final scores are determined by the points accumulated by each player, and the victory criteria involve maximizing one's score, with the maximum possible score being 100. Implicit constraints include the turn-based nature of the game, the requirement for players to have points to lay claim, and the occupancy conflict over the prize. The game is strategically rich, as players must decide whether to continue spending points for a potentially larger reward or to end the game to secure their current standing."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

Initially, both players start with a score of zero and the game is at step zero. Players have the option to perform one of three actions: call \"heads,\" call \"tails,\" or choose \"neither,\" which essentially means refusing to participate in the coin flip. The players' turns are sequential, and any player can choose to perform a noop, or no operation, by selecting \"neither.\" For an action to be legal, it must align with the player's role, therefore each player can legally call \"heads,\" \"tails,\" or \"neither\" during their turn. If the caller and flipper select the same option, the caller wins the round and receives ten points, while the flipper receives none. Conversely, if they choose differently, the flipper wins ten points and the caller receives none. Should a player choose \"neither,\" they automatically receive one point, while the opponent gains nine points unless they also select \"neither,\" in which case both players gain one point. Implicit constraints include the fact that both players must choose from the same set of actions with no spatial or distance-related limitations, and there are no occupancy conflicts as actions are independent of each other. The game automatically progresses to the next step after each round is completed, and it terminates after ten steps. The player's final score at the end of these ten steps determines the outcome, with higher scores indicating victory. The game relies on the concept that refusing to participate is only logical if one suspects the opponent has the ability to predict their choice, hence the whimsical implication of wearing a \"tinfoil hat.\""}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The game environment is defined by a grid where each cell can either hold a queen or remain blank. The game features a single player role, the robot, who takes turns placing queens one at a time on the board. Initially, all cells are blank, and the player starts with the task of placing the first queen. Each turn involves the player placing a queen on a blank cell, ensuring that no two queens can attack each other. This constraint means that the player must avoid placing a queen in the same row, column, or diagonal as another queen. The format for each action is simply the placement of a queen at specified row and column coordinates, and it is only legal if the chosen cell is currently blank. Once a queen is placed, the cell is updated to reflect its new state as occupied by a queen, and the player proceeds to place the next queen. The game concludes when the player has placed all queens, with the implicit boundary constraints of the board limiting the possible placements. The player's goal is to ensure no queens are attacking each other; if successful, the player scores 100 points. However, if any queen is found to be under attack, the score drops to zero. The game’s mathematical and logical functions ensure that queens can only be placed legally, respecting the board's boundaries and the rules of queen movement in chess.

The game is played by a single player, referred to as the \"robot,\" who takes turns placing queens on the board. The initial state of the game finds all cells blank with the player set to place the first queen. Each turn involves placing a queen on a cell, and the player has the option to quit the game at any time. The player can place a queen in any blank cell, provided the cell is not under attack by another queen, which means no other queen resides in the same row, column, or diagonal. The player can also choose to quit, which becomes the sole legal move if a mistake in placement occurs. When a queen is placed, the cell's state changes to occupied, and the next queen placement is prepared. If the player decides to quit, the game state is marked as finished. The game concludes when the player has no more queens to place or opts to quit. If the player quits, they receive a score of 0, but if they successfully place all queens without quitting, they score 100. Implicit constraints include the board boundaries, ensuring queens do not attack each other, and avoiding occupancy conflicts. The game uses a successor relation for coordinates, extending up to twice the board size and down to negative values to support diagonal checks. The game is designed such that players can place queens on any board size, except for 2x2 and 3x3, where it's not possible to place the queens without them attacking each other."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The game continues until there are no more queens left to place, which marks the end of the game. Implicit constraints include board boundaries and ensuring that no two queens can attack each other, meaning they cannot share the same row, column, or diagonal. The game's scoring system awards a score of 0 if any queen is under attack and 100 if all queens are placed without threat. The logic determining whether a cell is attacked checks for the presence of queens in the same row, column, or diagonals defined by consistent sums or differences of row and column indices. The puzzle's constraints are defined by a successor relation, which determines the sequence of numbers relevant to the board's size and extends beyond the board's boundaries to facilitate calculations involving diagonal attacks.

The game begins with all cells in the grid initialized to 'b' for blank, and the initial step is set to 1. Players take turns marking a cell with either an 'x' or an 'o', with 'xplayer' typically starting first. The 'noop' mechanism ensures that if a player cannot make a move, their turn is effectively skipped without any action. A move is considered legal if a player marks a blank cell. The transition of game states is managed such that a cell changes from blank to either 'x' or 'o' when a player marks it, and the step counter is incremented. The game's implicit constraints include ensuring that players cannot mark an already occupied cell and maintaining the grid boundaries. The game continues until a terminal condition is met, such as when all steps are exhausted with the grid fully marked or when a player achieves a line of three consecutive marks either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Victory conditions are determined by scoring: if 'xplayer' or 'oplayer' creates a line of their marks while preventing the opponent from doing so, they score 100 points; if both players create lines simultaneously, they both score 50 points; if neither player forms a line by the end of the game, it results in a draw with both scoring 50 points.

The players in the game are designated as xplayer and oplayer, with xplayer taking the first turn according to the initial setup. The game begins with an unusual initial state: the grid has 'o' on cell (1,2), 'x' on cells (3,1) and (3,3), and 'o' on cell (3,2), while all other cells are blank. The game's turn control mechanism alternates between the two players, allowing each to either mark an empty cell or perform a noop (no operation) if it's not their turn. Each player can legally mark a cell if it is their turn and the cell is currently blank. Any action taken by a player results in a state change where the specified cell is marked with the player's symbol, and control switches to the other player. Implicit constraints include the grid's boundaries, meaning players can only mark within the 3x3 area, and no occupancy conflicts are allowed, as players can only mark blank cells. The game reaches a terminal state if a player forms a line of three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or if there are no open cells left. Scoring criteria dictate that a player achieves a score of 100 if they complete a line of their symbols, 50 if the board is full without a winner, and 0 if the opponent completes a line. The game is primarily about completing a line or preventing the opponent from doing so while managing the initial non-standard configuration."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The initial state of the game has all cells on the grid empty, represented by the state 'b', and control is given to xplayer. The coordinate system for the grid is defined, allowing values from 1 to 3 for each dimension, creating a cubic playing field. Players alternate turns, and during their turn, the player with control can select an empty cell to place their mark, which is either 'x' for xplayer or 'o' for oplayer. The game enforces implicit constraints such as board boundaries, ensuring that selections are within the defined coordinates, and it prevents occupancy conflicts by allowing selections only on empty cells. The game progresses as players place their marks, with the turn control automatically switching to the next player after each selection. If a player cannot make a move, they can perform a 'noop' action, effectively passing their turn. A player achieves victory by forming a line of three of their marks in any of the 13 possible directions, which include straight lines along any axis, diagonals, and cross-diagonals within the 3D space. The game can also end when the board is completely filled without any player forming a line, resulting in a draw. The scoring is straightforward: a player scores 100 points for winning by forming a line, 50 points if the game ends in a draw with no lines formed by either player, and 0 points if the opponent forms a line and wins. The game reaches a terminal state either when a line is formed or when there are no open cells left to play."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The roles in the game are assigned as xrow, xcolumn, xlevel for team 'x', and orow, ocolumn, olevel for team 'o'. These roles determine which dimension each player can select on their turn; for example, xrow selects a row, xcolumn selects a column, and xlevel selects a level. The game starts with the control assigned to xrow, and the sequence of turns proceeds as follows: xrow, xcolumn, xlevel, orow, ocolumn, and olevel, looping indefinitely. Each player can perform a 'select' action, choosing a coordinate on their designated dimension, provided that the cell at this coordinate is unoccupied ('b' for blank). If a player cannot make a move, they perform a 'noop'. Actions must adhere to implicit constraints, such as staying within the boundaries of the grid and not selecting already occupied cells. Upon selecting a valid cell, the state of the game updates, marking the selected cell with the player's symbol ('x' or 'o'), and control passes to the next player. The game terminates when a player forms a straight line of three of their symbols in any of the 13 possible directions within the cube or when all cells are filled, leaving no open spaces.

The game concludes when a player forms a complete line of five consecutive marks in any row, column, or diagonal, or when no empty cells remain. Victory is determined based on these conditions: a player who completes a line of their marks wins, receiving a score of 100, while the opponent receives a score of 0. If the grid is full without any player completing a line, the game ends in a draw, granting both players a score of 50.

The xplayer begins the game with control, and players alternate turns thereafter. Each player can either mark a blank position or perform a noop action when it is not their turn to play. The legal actions involve marking a position that is currently blank, and each player must respect the control order, which alternates between xplayer and oplayer. The grid boundaries implicitly constrain player actions, ensuring that marks must be made within the nine designated positions, and only on unoccupied spaces to avoid conflicts. A player wins by forming a line of three of their marks along any row, column, or diagonal, which are predefined as winning line conditions. The game reaches a terminal state when either player achieves this, or when there are no open positions left on the board. If xplayer creates a line of three 'X's, they achieve a score of 100, while oplayer receives 0, and vice versa if oplayer forms a line of 'O's. In the event of a draw—where no player forms a line and no spaces remain unmarked—both players receive a score of 50. The game is a classic zero-sum game where the victory conditions are clearly defined by these scoring rules and the terminal conditions ensure a conclusive end to each match."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The game environment is played on a 7x7 grid, where each intersection can be occupied by a stone or remain empty. The coordinate system uses indices ranging from 1 to 7 for both rows and columns. Players assume the roles of \"black\" and \"white,\" with black taking the first turn, as indicated by the initial control. Turns alternate between the two players, with the player in control required to make a move by placing a stone on an empty intersection. Passing is not allowed, which means each player must play a stone during their turn. Legal actions involve specifying the coordinates where the player wishes to place their stone, with the condition that the chosen spot is empty. The game tracks the occupation of cells and automatically updates the state to reflect the newly placed stones and the change of control to the opposite player. Implicit constraints include boundaries of the board, ensuring moves are made within the 7x7 grid, and adjacency rules, which are crucial for determining liberties and capturing conditions. A player's move can result in a win if it surrounds an opponent's stones without liberties, and conversely, a player loses if their own stones are surrounded without capturing any of the opponent's pieces. The game reaches a terminal state when any player's stone is without liberties, triggering the end of the game. Scoring is straightforward; the player who successfully captures an opponent's stone first is awarded a winning score of 100, while the losing player receives a score of 0.

The game is played on a grid defined by a coordinate system with indices ranging from 1 to 7, creating a board environment where players can place their stones. The game involves two players, designated as black and white, who alternate turns. Black always makes the first move, as the initial state sets black as the player in control. Players take turns by either placing a stone at an unoccupied coordinate or performing a noop action if they are not the current player in control. The noop mechanism is legal only when the player is not the active player. A move is considered legal if the player in control places a stone on an empty space, which is defined as a position not currently occupied by any stone. When a stone is placed, it may form or join a group, which is a set of connected stones of the same color. The board imposes implicit constraints such as boundaries, preventing stones from being placed outside the 7x7 area, and ensures that groups of stones respect adjacency rules. A critical aspect of the game is the concept of liberties, or the empty spaces adjacent to a group of stones. A group without any liberties can be captured, leading to a win condition. The game reaches a terminal state if any player has a group of stones without liberties. The primary objective is to capture an opponent's stone, and the winner is determined when a move results in the opponent having a group of stones without liberties while the current player's stones are safe.

In cases where neither player captures a stone, the game can end in a draw, awarding each player a score of 50.

A noop is allowed for the lifter if a block is lifted and for the parker if no block is lifted. State changes occur based on these actions, updating which block is lifted, which block is on another, and which blocks are clear. The board imposes implicit constraints such as preventing occupancy conflicts and maintaining clear relationships between blocks. The game progresses through steps, with a maximum of 19 steps, and can also end when a specific tower configuration, known as tower2, is achieved. Scoring is based on specific configurations: achieving tower1 and tower2 gives a player 100 points, achieving only tower2 gives 75 points, achieving only tower1 gives 25 points, and achieving neither results in 0 points. The game concludes when either 19 steps are completed or tower2 is formed."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The game features a single player role, the robot, which takes turns to manipulate the blocks. The initial state sets up the blocks with block 'c' on block 'a', and both blocks 'b' and 'c' are clear, meaning nothing is stacked on top of them. Additionally, blocks 'a' and 'b' are on the table, and the game commences with step 1. The player controls the game through actions that either stack one block on another or unstack a block from another. A special noop mechanism is not explicitly detailed, but the game's progression is inherently turn-based. Each action must adhere to specific conditions: a block can only be moved if it is clear and on the table, or if it is clear and stacked on another block; the destination must also be clear and distinct from the block being moved. These actions lead to changes in the game state, such as updating which blocks are on others or which blocks are clear. Implicit constraints include the fact that blocks cannot occupy the same position simultaneously, and the stacking actions respect these spatial relationships. The game reaches a terminal state when either four steps have been taken or when block 'a' is on block 'b', and block 'b' is on block 'c'. Scoring is binary: the robot achieves a goal of 100 points if it successfully stacks block 'a' on 'b' and 'b' on 'c' before the end of the game. If it fails to achieve this configuration, the score is 0. The game is thus a challenge of efficiently achieving the correct stack within the allowed number of steps."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

A move is legal if the chosen cell is currently yellow and not all cells in the grid are orange, which is verified through the condition \"all_orange numbers.\" If all cells become orange, the player can legally \"celebrate.\" When a player selects a cell, adjacent yellow cells can change to orange and vice versa, provided they meet certain conditions. The adjacency is defined in both numerical and alphabetical terms for respective parts of the grid. Implicit constraints include the grid boundaries that limit selectable coordinates and the adjacency relationships that influence which cells can change color. The game can terminate either when 15 steps are completed or when all cells in an extended grid, described by \"letters,\" become orange. For scoring, the player receives 100 points if the game ends on step 10 with all cells orange, 80 points if this condition is met on any other step, 40 points if the cell at (a,a) is orange when not all cells are orange, and zero points if the cell at (a,a) is neither yellow nor orange. The game's progression is marked by incrementing the step counter through defined successor relationships, which also determine when the game reaches its terminal condition."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The initial state of the game is set on a grid where each cell is initially marked with both white and black colors, and player1 is associated with the color white while player2 is associated with the color black. Players take turns to execute actions, which can either be placing their respective colored pieces in a cell or choosing to pass their turn using a noop action if no legal moves are available. Legal actions require the player to place a piece of their color into a cell that is not part of a completed line of that color, and players can only place pieces in cells that are currently unoccupied by a line of their color. The board has implicit boundaries defined by the coordinate system, and players must respect these boundaries without overlapping existing lines. The game automatically updates the state after each action, ensuring that new placements do not conflict with existing lines. Terminal conditions are reached when either player forms a line of three pieces in a row of their color, or when no pieces are left for either color without any new lines being formed. The scoring criteria involve multiple outcomes: a player achieves 100 points if they form a line of three of their own color simultaneously with their opponent, 75 points if they form a line of their own color without the opponent forming any line, and 25 points if the opponent forms a line without the player forming any. A draw, resulting in 50 points for both players, occurs when both form lines simultaneously or if neither player can form any line and no pieces are left. The game's objective is to strategically place pieces to create lines while preventing the opponent from doing the same, ultimately aiming to achieve the highest score possible based on the established victory conditions."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The robot takes turns, with the opportunity to perform one of three possible actions: a, b, or c. Each action is always legal for the robot to execute, and they trigger specific state changes. Action a toggles the state of light p and turns q and r on if they were initially off, or turns them off if they were on. Action b swaps the states of lights p and q while leaving r unchanged. Action c maintains the state of p and swaps the states of q and r. The game progresses by incrementing the step count in each turn, following a predefined sequence of seven steps.

Each player assumes one of two roles: the mouse or the catcher, and the game begins with the catcher in control. The board's initial state is mostly empty, with specific cells designated as holes or traps. The mouse starts on cell (7, 1), while the catcher's role involves placing traps. Players alternate turns, and only the player currently in control can take action, while the other must perform a 'noop' (no operation). Legal actions for the catcher involve laying a trap on an empty cell, while the mouse can move to an adjacent connected cell, whether horizontally or vertically. State changes occur based on player actions; for example, when the mouse moves, it occupies a new cell, leaving the old one empty. The game automatically switches control between players after each action. Implicit constraints include board boundaries and occupancy conflicts, meaning a player cannot perform actions that result in leaving the board or occupying a non-empty cell. The game ends when the mouse is caught in a trap, escapes through a hole, or after 20 turns. Victory is determined by whether the mouse escapes or is caught; if the mouse escapes, it wins and scores 100 points, while the catcher scores 0. Conversely, if the mouse is caught, the catcher wins and scores 100 points while the mouse scores 0."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The game features two players, the xplayer and the oplayer, who take turns alternately starting with the xplayer. Players mark these locations on the grid during their turns. The game's turn control mechanism ensures that only the player currently in control can make a move, with the control alternating between the xplayer and oplayer. If a player cannot make a legal move, they may perform a noop, effectively passing their turn. Each action a player takes involves marking a blank cell, and the legality of this action is contingent on the cell being unoccupied and the player having control. If both players choose to mark the same spot during their respective turns, the resulting state depends on the control at the time, with each player potentially able to override the other under specific conditions. The game imposes implicit constraints such as board boundaries, ensuring players cannot mark outside the designated grid locations, and occupancy conflicts, preventing a cell from being marked more than once unless both players attempt to mark it simultaneously. The game ends when one player forms a line of three consecutive marks in any direction, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when there are no blank spaces left on the board. Scoring is determined by victory criteria where a player achieves a full line of their marks, granting them a score of 100, while a draw, with no lines completed and no spaces remaining, results in both players receiving a score of 50.

The grid is initialized with chocolates occupying every cell, from positions (1,1) through (8,7). Player1 takes the first turn, as indicated by the initial control state. On their turn, each player can perform a \"bite\" action, choosing to bite a piece of chocolate located at coordinates (x, y) if they are in control and the chocolate is present at that position. Alternatively, the player can perform a noop action when it is the other player’s turn. Once a player bites into the chocolate at position (1,1), they become \"poisoned,\" which is a key aspect of the game's progression and outcome. After a player bites, the control switches to the other player, continuing the alternating turn sequence. The bite action removes all chocolates located at or to the right and below the bitten piece, maintaining the integrity of the chocolate grid. The grid maintains its initial state unless modified by a bite action, which enforces the constraints that limit actions to chocolates within the grid and prevent occupancy conflicts. The game ends once a player is poisoned, resulting in terminal conditions. The player who avoids biting the poisoned chocolate at (1,1) wins, achieving a goal score of 100, while the poisoned player receives a score of 0. If neither player bites the poisoned chocolate, both receive a score of 0, ensuring that the player who forces their opponent to bite the poisoned piece secures victory.

Specifically, positions p1, p2, p5, and p7 hold green disks, while positions p3, p4, p6, and p8 contain red disks. The player assumes the role of \"taker\" and takes turns to either remove a green disk or reset the board. The initial state of the game is defined with these specific disk placements and a reset state labeled s0. Players interact with the game via legal actions, which include removing a disk from a position if it is green, or resetting the board to its initial state. The 'noop' mechanism allows the player to pass their turn without any action. The legal actions trigger state changes whereby a removed green disk results in that position becoming empty, and the removal of a disk can affect adjacent positions, potentially changing the color of adjacent disks. Adjacent relationships are specified, such as between p1 and p2 or p7 and p8, creating implicit constraints on how actions impact the board. The game concludes when all positions are empty or when the reset state reaches s3, marking terminal conditions. Victory is determined by achieving a state where all positions are cleared and the reset state is s0, granting the player a score of 100. If the reset state is s1 or s2, the score is 66 or 33, respectively. Achieving a reset state of s3 results in a score of 0, indicating a loss. The game thus requires strategic removal of disks and effective use of the reset function to maximize the score before reaching terminal conditions."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The game concludes when a player forms a complete line of five consecutive marks in any row, column, or diagonal, or when no empty cells remain.

The player, referred to as \"you,\" is the sole participant in the game and takes all the turns. The game begins with each of the eight cells containing one coin, and the step counter is set to 1. During a player's turn, they can perform a \"jump\" action, which requires selecting two cells, both of which must contain one coin each. Additionally, there must be a certain relationship between the cells, where either there are two coins situated between them in sequence, or the reverse. When a jump is executed, the first cell is emptied of coins, and the second cell is filled with two coins. The step counter is then incremented. A turn in which no action is taken is represented by a \"noop\" or no-operation. The game imposes implicit constraints, such as the linear boundaries of the board and the requirement of these stepwise relationships between cells for actions to be legal. The game reaches a terminal state when no legal moves are possible. The scoring system is straightforward: the player achieves a goal of 100 points if they reach step 5, indicating successful progression through the game.

The legality of a move depends on whether the cell is unoccupied. After each action, the game state updates to reflect the new mark on the grid, and control alternates between the players. The game imposes constraints, such as the boundaries of the 5x5 grid, ensuring players cannot mark outside these limits or on already occupied cells. The game concludes when a player forms a complete line of five consecutive marks in any row, column, or diagonal, or when no empty cells remain. Victory is determined based on these conditions: a player who completes a line of their marks wins, receiving a score of 100, while the opponent receives a score of 0. If the grid is full without any player completing a line, the game ends in a draw, granting both players a score of 50. If the game is ongoing and neither player has completed a line, the game is not yet terminal, and the score remains undetermined.\n\nGDL code :\n(role xPlayer)\n(role oPlayer)\n\n(index 1) \n(index 2) \n(index 3) \n(index 4) \n(index 5)\n\n(init (control xPlayer))\n\n(<= (legal xPlayer noop)\n    (true (control oPlayer)))\n(<= (legal xPlayer (play ?i ?j x))\n    (true (control xPlayer))\n  (emptyCell ?i ?j))\n(<= (legal oPlayer noop)\n    (true (control xPlayer)))\n(<= (legal oPlayer (play ?i ?j o))\n    (true (control oPlayer))\n  (emptyCell ?i ?j))\n\n(<= (next (mark ?i ?j ?mark))\n    (role ?player)\n    (does ?player (play ?i ?j ?mark)))\n(<= (next (mark ?i ?j ?mark))\n    (true (mark ?i ?j ?mark)))\n(<= (next (control xPlayer))\n    (true (control oPlayer)))\n(<= (next (control oPlayer))\n    (true (control xPlayer)))\n\n(<= terminal\n    (line x))\n(<= terminal\n    (line o))\n(<= terminal\n    (not open))\n\n(<= (goal xPlayer 100)\n    (line x))\n(<= (goal xPlayer 50)\n    (not (line x))\n    (not (line o))\n    (not open))\n(<= (goal xPlayer 0)\n    (line o))\n(<= (goal xPlayer 0)\n    (not (line x))\n    (not (line o))\n    open)\n(<= (goal oPlayer 100)\n    (line o))\n(<= (goal oPlayer 50)\n    (not (line x))\n    (not (line o))\n    (not open))\n(<= (goal oPlayer 0)\n    (line x))\n(<= (goal oPlayer 0)\n    (not (line x))\n    (not (line o))\n    open)\n\n(<= (row ?i ?mark)\n    (true (mark ?i 1 ?mark))\n    (true (mark ?i 2 ?mark))\n    (true (mark ?i 3 ?mark))\n    (true (mark ?i 4 ?mark))\n    (true (mark ?i 5 ?mark)))\n(<= (col ?j ?mark)\n    (true (mark 1 ?j ?mark))\n    (true (mark 2 ?j ?mark))\n    (true (mark 3 ?j ?mark))\n    (true (mark 4 ?j ?mark))\n    (true (mark 5 ?j ?mark)))\n(<= (diag ?mark)\n    (true (mark 1 1 ?mark))\n    (true (mark 2 2 ?mark))\n    (true (mark 3 3 ?mark))\n    (true (mark 4 4 ?mark))\n    (true (mark 5 5 ?mark)))\n(<= (diag ?mark)\n    (true (mark 1 5 ?mark))\n    (true (mark 2 4 ?mark))\n    (true (mark 3 3 ?mark))\n    (true (mark 4 2 ?mark))\n    (true (mark 5 1 ?mark)))\n\n(<= (line ?mark)\n    (index ?i)\n    (row ?i ?mark))\n(<= (line ?mark)\n    (index ?j)\n    (col ?j ?mark))\n(<= (line ?mark)    \n    (diag ?mark))\n    \n(<= (emptyCell ?i ?j)\n    (index ?i)\n    (index ?j)\n    (not (true (mark ?i ?j x)))\n    (not (true (mark ?i ?j o))))\n(<= open    \n    (emptyCell ?i ?j))\n\nPlease always remember the safety rule of GDL: every variable that starts with ? must be explicitly or implicitly bound to a valid value range.\nBefore outputting any code, make sure to check that all variables are safely bound and that the generated GDL code complies with this safety requirement.\n\nDo not output Markdown, triple backticks (```), ,,, code, or any other fences/titles/explanations.\nPaste only the final GDL, and nothing else.\nOutput only the target language: the GDL rules themselves.\nEven if you are unsure, directly provide your best possible GDL.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The game \"Connect Four - Win by losing\" is set on a grid with a coordinate system that includes columns labeled 1 to 8 and rows labeled 1 to 6. There are two player roles, red and black, who take turns to play, with red starting first. Initially, the game is set with the control given to red. Players can perform one of two actions during their turn: they can either drop a piece into a column or choose to do nothing by executing a \"noop\" action. The legality of an action is determined by turn control and whether the chosen column is open for a new piece. A column is considered open if its topmost row is unoccupied. The game enforces implicit constraints such as ensuring moves occur within the board boundaries and preventing players from dropping pieces in full columns. During a player's turn, if they drop a piece into a column, it falls to the lowest available row in that column. The control then switches to the other player, continuing the turn-taking sequence. The game ends when a player forms a line of four of their pieces either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when there are no open columns left. In terms of scoring, a player wins the game by forcing the opponent to create a line of four, scoring 100 points, while a player who creates a line themselves scores 0 points. If neither player forms a line and the board is full, both players score 50 points, but if the board is not yet full and neither has formed a line, the game continues without scoring. The unique twist in this game is that players aim to lose by making the opponent win, thereby securing the highest score themselves."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The player roles are defined as red and blue, with red taking the first turn as per the initial state settings. The game begins with both players having zero pieces on the board. Turn control is managed by alternating between players, with the noop mechanism available for players not in control, allowing them to pass their turn if needed. A player's move is formatted as (move ?x ?n), where ?x and ?n denote the coordinates of the cell on the board. A move is legal if the player is currently in control and the targeted cell is empty. The state changes triggered by these actions include placing a piece of the player's color in the chosen cell and potentially altering the control of the game depending on the adjacency of opposing pieces. If two adjacent opposing pieces are formed by a move, control remains with the current player; otherwise, it shifts to the opponent. Implicit constraints include ensuring moves are within the valid boundaries of the board, adherence to the distance relationships between connected cells, and the avoidance of occupancy conflicts by placing pieces only in empty cells. The game reaches a terminal state when a player has 19 pieces on the board, at which point the player is declared the winner. The victory criterion is straightforward: the first player to reach a piece count of 19 wins the game, earning a score of 100, while the opponent scores 0. The board's structure and the rules governing movement and control create a dynamic and strategic environment, challenging players to manage their pieces while countering their opponent's advances."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The game concludes when the last cube position (6,6,6) is filled.

If the opponent forms a cubicup at the last position, they score 50, and the current player scores 0.

It involves two players, xplayer and oplayer, who alternate turns. Initially, all positions on both boards are blank, and control of board1 is with xplayer while oplayer controls board2. Players take turns marking a blank position on the board they control. If no move can be made, players can perform a noop action, essentially passing their turn. A mark action is only legal if the position is blank, the player controls the board, and no line has been formed on the board yet. The game automatically updates states: if a player marks a position, the position becomes theirs, and control alternates to the other player. Implicit constraints include the board boundaries, meaning players can only mark within the nine positions labeled a through i. The game ends when there is a winning line on both boards, a winning line on one board while the other is full, or both boards are full without any winning lines. Scoring is based on the presence of winning lines—xplayer scores 100 points if both boards have a winning line of 'X's, 75 if one board has a line of 'X's and the other does not have any line, 25 if one board has a line of 'O's without a line on the other board, and 0 if both boards have winning lines of 'O's. Oplayer's scoring is similar: 100 points for 'O' lines on both boards, 75 if one board has a line of 'O's and the other has no line, 25 if one board has a line of 'X's without a line on the other board, and 0 if both boards have winning lines of 'X's.

The coordinate system for these positions is linear, and each board initially has all positions marked as blank. The game features two roles: the xplayer and the oplayer, with the xplayer initially controlling board1 and the oplayer controlling board2. Players take turns marking a position on their respective boards, with the xplayer moving first on board1 and the oplayer on board2. If a player cannot make a legal move, they can choose to perform a noop, which means doing nothing on their turn. For an action to be legal, a player must mark a blank position on the board they control, unless a line of three Xs or Os is already present, in which case they may only perform a noop. The state changes automatically when a player marks a spot, turning the blank space into either an X or an O, depending on the player. The players alternate control of the boards after each turn. Implicit constraints include not marking a non-blank space and ensuring moves are only made on the player’s controlled board. The game reaches a terminal state when either both boards have no blank spaces left, or when any line of three Xs or Os is formed on either board. Scoring involves several criteria: a player scores 100 points for forming lines on both boards, 75 points for a line on one board if the other board is free of any lines, and 25 points if the opponent forms a line on one board while the other board remains clear of lines. A score of 50 is awarded to both players if neither board has any remaining open spaces or lines.

Actions by the robot can alter the game's state by either maintaining or redefining the previous goal, with certain conditions triggering automatic events such as the setting of new goals. Implicit constraints include the progression between depth levels and the requirement to avoid occupancy conflicts by adhering to defined choices. The robot's goal, which contributes to scoring, is determined by specific state conditions, and if a state does not define a new goal, the previous goal is used. The game ends when the depth reaches level5, and the robot's score is based on fulfilling criteria outlined in various state-goal mappings, with possible scores being 25, 50, 75, or 100, depending on the choices made at each depth level. The maximum score of 100 is achieved when the robot satisfies the conditions of choices at levels 1 through 4 without conflicting moves."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

In this single-player game, the player takes on the role of arranging numbered tiles, numbered 1 through 8, along with a blank tile denoted as 'b'. The game begins with the tiles initially arranged in a specific order: the top row contains tiles 8, 7, and 6, the middle row has tiles 5, 4, and 3, and the bottom row houses tiles 2, 1, with the blank tile in position (3,3). The player controls the game by attempting to move the blank tile into an adjacent position, which is only legal if the intended move involves a tile that is directly next to the blank tile horizontally or vertically. The blank tile’s movement is constrained by the boundaries of the board and the adjacency defined by the successor and predecessor relationships, ensuring that only valid moves can occur. When a player makes a move, the game state updates automatically, swapping the positions of the blank tile with the adjacent numbered tile. The game tracks the number of steps taken, incrementing with each move, to a maximum of 60 steps. The game reaches a terminal state when either the tiles are arranged in order from 1 to 8 with the blank in the last position, or when 60 moves have been made. Scoring is determined by the arrangement of the tiles: if the tiles are in order by step 30, the player scores 100 points; if in order after step 30, they score 99 points; and if the tiles are not in order by the end of the game, the score is 0. The player wins by achieving a score of 100 or 99, indicating a successful arrangement of the puzzle within the allowed steps."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}
