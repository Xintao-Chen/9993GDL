Initially, the white player has control and may choose to either move a piece or perform a noop action, which effectively passes the turn. The legality of any move depends on several conditions: the player must control the turn, the starting cell must contain one of their pieces, the move must conform to a knight-like pattern characteristic of chess, and the destination cell must not already be occupied by one of their pieces. A move updates the game state by relocating the piece and switching control to the opposing player. Implicit constraints include ensuring moves remain within the board boundaries and that distinct cells are non-overlapping. The game concludes when a player achieves a \"win\" condition, which occurs if a white piece reaches the top row or a black piece reaches the bottom row, or if one player completely eliminates the other's pieces.

The game begins with all cells unlit and the step count at zero. The robot's task is to light up cells across four distinct 2x2 regions within this grid, and it takes turns by executing the “press” action. This action is legal when pressing occurs within specified indices: x1 and y1 must be 1 or 2, while x2 and y2, as well as x3 and y3, must be 3 or 4. The robot can press up to four cells simultaneously, and each press changes the state of the affected cells to 4, indicating they are fully lit. Subsequently, these cells will gradually reduce in value each turn, simulating lights dimming, until they return to zero if not pressed again. Implicit constraints of the game include ensuring actions remain within the grid boundaries and avoiding occupancy conflicts where multiple presses affect the same cell. The game can end in two ways: either when the step count reaches 20 or if all four 2x2 sections of the grid are successfully lit, referred to as lightsOn1, lightsOn2, lightsOn3, and lightsOn4. Winning conditions are met if any of these sections are fully lit, granting the robot a score of 100. Failure to light up any section by the terminal condition results in a score of 0.

The game features a single player role, the robot, which takes turns to manipulate the blocks. The initial state sets up the blocks with block 'c' on block 'a', and both blocks 'b' and 'c' are clear, meaning nothing is stacked on top of them. Additionally, blocks 'a' and 'b' are on the table, and the game commences with step 1. The player controls the game through actions that either stack one block on another or unstack a block from another. A special noop mechanism is not explicitly detailed, but the game's progression is inherently turn-based. Each action must adhere to specific conditions: a block can only be moved if it is clear and on the table, or if it is clear and stacked on another block; the destination must also be clear and distinct from the block being moved. These actions lead to changes in the game state, such as updating which blocks are on others or which blocks are clear. Implicit constraints include the fact that blocks cannot occupy the same position simultaneously, and the stacking actions respect these spatial relationships. The game reaches a terminal state when either four steps have been taken or when block 'a' is on block 'b', and block 'b' is on block 'c'. Scoring is binary: the robot achieves a goal of 100 points if it successfully stacks block 'a' on 'b' and 'b' on 'c' before the end of the game. If it fails to achieve this configuration, the score is 0. The game is thus a challenge of efficiently achieving the correct stack within the allowed number of steps."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The player takes on the singular role of navigating these subgames, specifically moving between positions in two separate graphs: graph 1 involves a sequence of positions a, b, and c, while graph 2 consists of x, y, and z. The game begins with the initial state where position pos1 is set to a and position pos2 is set to x. During each turn, the player can perform one of two actions: move1 or move2, each associated with a target position. The move1 action is legal if the current position in pos1 is connected to the target position via conn1, and similarly, move2 is legal if the current position in pos2 is connected to the target position via conn2. State changes are triggered by these actions, resulting in the updating of the positions pos1 and pos2 as per the executed move. The game applies implicit constraints such as ensuring movements respect the boundaries of the graphs and maintaining the integrity of the defined connections. The game reaches a terminal condition when specific combinations of positions are achieved, such as pos1 being c and pos2 being z, or other specified end states. The player scores a victory with a goal score of 100 if they successfully navigate pos1 to c and pos2 to z, while any deviation from achieving both these end positions results in a score of 0. The design of the game highlights the complexity in planning, as even though the subgames have straightforward local plans, combining them into a global strategy is non-trivial."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

Two players, designated as \"red\" and \"black,\" alternately take turns, with the red player always starting first. The initial state of the game is determined by the player in control, which at the beginning is red. Turn control involves a mechanism known as \"noop,\" where a player does nothing while the other player is in control, ensuring smooth alternation between players. Legal actions for each player consist of dropping a piece into one of the board's columns, but only if the column is open, meaning it is not full. The format of an action is specified as a drop into a specific column, such as (drop ?x), where ?x represents the column number. Upon executing a drop action, the game state changes as the piece occupies the lowest available cell in the specified column, with automatic events managing the alternate control of the game between players. Constraints within the game include the boundaries of the board, ensuring that pieces cannot be placed outside the designated columns and rows, and avoiding occupancy conflicts by only allowing pieces to be placed in open cells. The game concludes when a player forms a line of four consecutive pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when the board is completely filled, leaving no open columns. Scoring criteria dictate that if a player achieves a line of four, they score 100 points, and if neither player forms a line and the board is full, both players score 50 points. If the opposing player wins, the player in question scores zero. Throughout the game, the implicit constraints and rules ensure a fair and competitive environment, challenging players to strategically outmaneuver their opponent to achieve victory."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

Specifically, positions p1, p2, p5, and p7 hold green disks, while positions p3, p4, p6, and p8 contain red disks. The player assumes the role of \"taker\" and takes turns to either remove a green disk or reset the board. The initial state of the game is defined with these specific disk placements and a reset state labeled s0. Players interact with the game via legal actions, which include removing a disk from a position if it is green, or resetting the board to its initial state. The 'noop' mechanism allows the player to pass their turn without any action. The legal actions trigger state changes whereby a removed green disk results in that position becoming empty, and the removal of a disk can affect adjacent positions, potentially changing the color of adjacent disks. Adjacent relationships are specified, such as between p1 and p2 or p7 and p8, creating implicit constraints on how actions impact the board. The game concludes when all positions are empty or when the reset state reaches s3, marking terminal conditions. Victory is determined by achieving a state where all positions are cleared and the reset state is s0, granting the player a score of 100. If the reset state is s1 or s2, the score is 66 or 33, respectively. Achieving a reset state of s3 results in a score of 0, indicating a loss.

The board is 15 columns wide and 4 rows high, with certain fields blocked by walls or fire. The game begins with the kitten positioned at coordinates (8, 2) and the round counter set to 0. Players take turns in a sequential manner, with the kitten being the only active role. The primary objective is for the kitten to navigate from its starting position to the goal located at (15, 4), avoiding the increasing fire that consumes one column from the left each round. During each turn, the player can choose from a set of legal moves, including up, down, left, or right, as long as the destination is within the board’s boundaries and adjacent to the current position. If a move is made, the kitten's position updates to the new coordinates, and the round counter increases by one. The game incorporates implicit constraints such as boundary limits, preventing the kitten from moving into walls or previously blocked fields. The game concludes under one of three terminal conditions: the kitten reaches the goal, the fire overtakes the kitten's position, or the maximum number of rounds (16) is reached. Victory is achieved if the kitten successfully reaches the goal, earning a score of 100.

There are two players, each assuming a distinct role: the \"crosser\" and the \"blocker\". The turns are structured such that both players alternate in taking actions. Initially, every cell on the board is marked as empty, denoted by 'b'. During their turn, each player can choose to take a specific action, which involves marking a cell. The crosser aims to mark a sequence of connected cells across the board from the first column to the fourth, while the blocker aims to prevent this. The noop mechanism is in place, meaning that if a player cannot make a legal move, they effectively do nothing that turn. An action is formatted as the player marking a specific cell, and for it to be legal, the targeted cell must be empty and the player must be eligible to make a move. When a crosser marks a cell, it becomes a crosser cell, unless the blocker has already marked it. Conversely, a blocker can only mark an empty cell. The board maintains implicit constraints such as boundary limits of the grid, preventing any moves outside the 1 to 4 index range, and ensures no cell can be occupied by both players simultaneously. The game reaches a terminal state if the crosser successfully creates a continuous path from the left to the right of the board, or if there are no empty cells remaining. In terms of scoring, if the crosser creates a path, they score 100 points and the blocker scores 0. If the game ends without a path and no empty cells are left, the blocker scores 100 points and the crosser scores 0.

There are two players, referred to as xPlayer and oPlayer, who alternate turns throughout the game. Initially, the xPlayer is in control and begins the game. Players can either make a move by placing their respective marks ('x' or 'o') on an empty cell or choose to 'noop', which effectively passes the turn. The 'noop' action is only legal when it is the other player's turn. A move is deemed legal if the cell at the specified coordinates is unoccupied. Each action, when executed, results in the marking of the grid and the transfer of control to the other player. Implicit constraints include the boundaries of the grid, ensuring that players can only mark within the 3x3 board, and that they cannot place a mark on an already occupied cell. The game reaches a terminal state if a player completes a line of three of their marks, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or if there are no open spaces left on the board. If a player forms a line, they win, scoring 100 points. If the board is full with no lines formed, it results in a draw, and both players score 50 points. Conversely, if one player forms a line, the opposing player scores 0.

Players assume the roles of player1 and player2, with player1 starting the game. Players take turns alternatively, with control switching to the other player after each move. During their turn, a player can either perform a noop action, which means doing nothing, or opt to reduce the number of units in one of the heaps. The noop action is only legal if the player does not have control, whereas a reduction is allowed if the player has control and the number to reduce (n) is smaller than the current number of units in the chosen heap (m). Once a player decides to reduce a heap, the game's state is updated to reflect this change, and the heap's count is decreased by the chosen amount. The control then shifts to the other player. Implicit constraints include the board boundaries ensuring that the heaps cannot have negative units and the occupancy conflicts are managed by the rules that prevent illegal reductions. The game concludes when all heaps are reduced to zero, marking the terminal condition. At the end of the game, the player who last had control of the game wins and is awarded a score of 100, while the other player receives a score of 0. Victory is determined by successfully depleting all heaps while maintaining control.

Six players are divided into two teams, with each team representing a different symbol: 'x' or 'o'. The roles in the game are assigned as xrow, xcolumn, xlevel for team 'x', and orow, ocolumn, olevel for team 'o'. These roles determine which dimension each player can select on their turn; for example, xrow selects a row, xcolumn selects a column, and xlevel selects a level. The game starts with the control assigned to xrow, and the sequence of turns proceeds as follows: xrow, xcolumn, xlevel, orow, ocolumn, and olevel, looping indefinitely. Each player can perform a 'select' action, choosing a coordinate on their designated dimension, provided that the cell at this coordinate is unoccupied ('b' for blank). If a player cannot make a move, they perform a 'noop'. Actions must adhere to implicit constraints, such as staying within the boundaries of the grid and not selecting already occupied cells. Upon selecting a valid cell, the state of the game updates, marking the selected cell with the player's symbol ('x' or 'o'), and control passes to the next player. The game terminates when a player forms a straight line of three of their symbols in any of the 13 possible directions within the cube or when all cells are filled, leaving no open spaces. Scoring is straightforward: a player who creates a line receives 100 points, while players who do not create a line and do not lose receive 50 points, and those on the losing team receive 0 points. If no player forms a line and the board fills completely, the game results in a draw, with all players receiving 50 points."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The game begins with the white player in control of the first turn. On a player's turn, they have the option to either lay claim to the prize by spending one point, provided they have points remaining, or to end the game. Additionally, a player may choose to take no action during their turn, represented by the noop mechanism, which means they pass control to their opponent. Each player's action must adhere to certain conditions; for instance, laying claim to the prize requires that the player is currently in control and has at least one point to spend. When a player lays claim, their score decreases by one point, whereas if they end the game, the player who last laid claim receives an additional five points to their score. The game continues with alternating turns until a player decides to end it, at which point the game's terminal condition is met. The final scores are determined by the points accumulated by each player, and the victory criteria involve maximizing one's score, with the maximum possible score being 100. Implicit constraints include the turn-based nature of the game, the requirement for players to have points to lay claim, and the occupancy conflict over the prize.
