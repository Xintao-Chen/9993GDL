Each cell in this grid can be in one of two states: \"light\" or \"nolight.\" Initially, the board is set up such that certain cells are lit and others are not, as specified in the initial configuration. The game involves a single player who takes turns to switch the state of the cells. During each turn, the player can perform a \"switch\" action on a cell at coordinates (x, y) as long as those coordinates are valid, meaning they fall within the 1 to 5 range. This switch action is legal if it targets any cell on the board. Performing a switch affects not only the targeted cell but also its adjacent ones, flipping their states from light to nolight or vice versa. The game progresses through a sequence of steps, starting from step 0, with each step representing a turn. The player may choose to perform an action or opt for a \"noop\" (no operation), effectively passing their turn. The game concludes under two terminal conditions: either when the game reaches step 20 or when there are no cells in the \"light\" state, known as the \"lighton\" condition. The victory condition is based on whether the board has any lights on; if there are no lights on, the player scores 100 points, indicating a win, otherwise, they score 0 points. The game mechanics implicitly enforce several constraints, such as board boundaries, meaning actions are only applicable within the defined grid, and the effects of an action are limited by adjacency, affecting only neighboring cells. The player's objective is to strategically switch the cells to achieve the desired end state within the given number of steps."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

Players take turns to execute actions, which can either be placing their respective colored pieces in a cell or choosing to pass their turn using a noop action if no legal moves are available. Legal actions require the player to place a piece of their color into a cell that is not part of a completed line of that color, and players can only place pieces in cells that are currently unoccupied by a line of their color. The board has implicit boundaries defined by the coordinate system, and players must respect these boundaries without overlapping existing lines. The game automatically updates the state after each action, ensuring that new placements do not conflict with existing lines. Terminal conditions are reached when either player forms a line of three pieces in a row of their color, or when no pieces are left for either color without any new lines being formed. The scoring criteria involve multiple outcomes: a player achieves 100 points if they form a line of three of their own color simultaneously with their opponent, 75 points if they form a line of their own color without the opponent forming any line, and 25 points if the opponent forms a line without the player forming any.

The game is set on a coordinate grid representing the Connect Four board, with columns numbered from 1 to 7 and rows also numbered from 1 to 7. The initial state sees \"red\" in control, and players alternate turns, with \"red\" going first. Each player can either make a move by dropping a token into one of the columns or perform a noop action, which is legal only when it is not that player's turn. A move is considered legal if the player in control drops a token into an open column. The state of the board changes automatically with each move: a token dropped into a column occupies the lowest available cell in that column. The control of the game switches to the other player after each turn. Implicit constraints include the boundaries of the board, as tokens must be placed within the 7x7 grid, and the requirement that tokens cannot be placed in full columns. The game reaches a terminal state when a player forms a line of four consecutive tokens horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when no more moves are possible because the board is full. Scoring is unique in this variant of Connect Four: a player wins by losing. If \"red\" forms a line, \"black\" scores 100, and vice versa. If no lines are formed and the board is full, both players score 50. When the board is not full and no lines are formed, both players receive a score of zero. Thus, the strategic aim is to force the opponent into winning by forming a line, achieving victory through a score of 100."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The game begins with the robot in the initial state labeled q1, and the step count set to 1. The robot alone takes turns, and each turn involves selecting one of the legal actions, denoted by letters a through h. The robot can either move forward through these actions or decide to do nothing, a situation managed by what is termed the noop mechanism, where the state does not change if no action is taken. Each action has a straightforward format, being a simple choice among the available legal actions, and is considered legal as long as the robot selects from these given options. The state transitions depend on the robot's chosen action; performing actions a through g keeps the robot in states q1 or p, while action h, when used in specific conditions such as when p is not true, allows progression through states q2 to q8. Implicit constraints in the game include the necessity of following the succession of steps, as defined from 1 to 8, and the requirement that conditions must be met to advance states, particularly with action h.

The game environment is played on a 7x7 grid, where each intersection can be occupied by a stone or remain empty. The coordinate system uses indices ranging from 1 to 7 for both rows and columns. Players assume the roles of \"black\" and \"white,\" with black taking the first turn, as indicated by the initial control. Turns alternate between the two players, with the player in control required to make a move by placing a stone on an empty intersection. Passing is not allowed, which means each player must play a stone during their turn. Legal actions involve specifying the coordinates where the player wishes to place their stone, with the condition that the chosen spot is empty. The game tracks the occupation of cells and automatically updates the state to reflect the newly placed stones and the change of control to the opposite player. Implicit constraints include boundaries of the board, ensuring moves are made within the 7x7 grid, and adjacency rules, which are crucial for determining liberties and capturing conditions. A player's move can result in a win if it surrounds an opponent's stones without liberties, and conversely, a player loses if their own stones are surrounded without capturing any of the opponent's pieces. The game reaches a terminal state when any player's stone is without liberties, triggering the end of the game. Scoring is straightforward; the player who successfully captures an opponent's stone first is awarded a winning score of 100, while the losing player receives a score of 0. If no winner emerges, both players are assigned a neutral score of 50."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The players in this game are assigned the roles of black and white, with black always making the first move. The initial state of the game assigns control to the black player. Players alternate turns, and when it's not a player's turn, they can legally perform a 'noop' action, meaning they do nothing. On a player's turn, they can place a piece on any empty cell, defined as a cell that is indexed but not occupied by a piece. Once a player places their piece on an empty cell, the action results in a state change where the cell becomes occupied by that player's color. The game automatically switches control to the other player after a move. The game is bound by implicit constraints such as board boundaries, ensuring that pieces cannot be placed outside the 11x11 grid, and occupancy conflicts, which prevent placing a piece on an already occupied cell. The game reaches a terminal state when there are no empty cells left on the board or when a player successfully forms a line of exactly five consecutive pieces, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The player roles are defined as red and blue, with red taking the first turn as per the initial state settings. The game begins with both players having zero pieces on the board. Turn control is managed by alternating between players, with the noop mechanism available for players not in control, allowing them to pass their turn if needed. A player's move is formatted as (move ?x ?n), where ?x and ?n denote the coordinates of the cell on the board. A move is legal if the player is currently in control and the targeted cell is empty. The state changes triggered by these actions include placing a piece of the player's color in the chosen cell and potentially altering the control of the game depending on the adjacency of opposing pieces. If two adjacent opposing pieces are formed by a move, control remains with the current player; otherwise, it shifts to the opponent. Implicit constraints include ensuring moves are within the valid boundaries of the board, adherence to the distance relationships between connected cells, and the avoidance of occupancy conflicts by placing pieces only in empty cells. The game reaches a terminal state when a player has 19 pieces on the board, at which point the player is declared the winner. The victory criterion is straightforward: the first player to reach a piece count of 19 wins the game, earning a score of 100, while the opponent scores 0. The board's structure and the rules governing movement and control create a dynamic and strategic environment, challenging players to manage their pieces while countering their opponent's advances."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The player takes on the role of the \"robot,\" who is the sole participant and thus operates independently, taking turns in a sequential and unopposed manner. The game begins with the robot positioned at location 'a,' while a piece of gold is initially placed at location 'c.' The game tracks progression through a step counter that starts at 1. During each turn, the robot can perform one of three actions: move, grab, or drop. The move action is only legal if the robot's current position is adjacent to the target position, aligning with the predefined adjacency rules. The robot can grab the gold if it is on the same cell as the gold, and it can drop the gold at its current position only if it is carrying the gold, denoted by the gold being held at a special location 'i.' Legal actions are determined by the current game state, and if no legal action is possible, a \"noop\" or no-operation action can occur, essentially passing the turn. When a move is executed, the robot advances to an adjacent cell, and if a grab occurs, the gold moves with the robot or stays put if it's not picked up. Dropping the gold places it at the robot's current location.

This setup excludes the possibility of solving the puzzle on 2x2 or 3x3 boards. The game is played by a single player, referred to as \"robot,\" who takes turns placing each queen on the board. The game begins with all cells on the board being empty, and the player is tasked with placing the first queen. During each turn, the player places a queen on any cell that is currently blank, following the rule that a move is only legal if the cell is unoccupied. Once a queen is placed, the cell's state changes from blank to occupied by a queen, while other cells remain unchanged. The game continues until there are no more queens left to place, which marks the end of the game. Implicit constraints include board boundaries and ensuring that no two queens can attack each other, meaning they cannot share the same row, column, or diagonal. The game's scoring system awards a score of 0 if any queen is under attack and 100 if all queens are placed without threat. The logic determining whether a cell is attacked checks for the presence of queens in the same row, column, or diagonals defined by consistent sums or differences of row and column indices. The puzzle's constraints are defined by a successor relation, which determines the sequence of numbers relevant to the board's size and extends beyond the board's boundaries to facilitate calculations involving diagonal attacks. The challenge is to strategically place each queen to achieve the maximum score by ensuring all are safe from attack."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The game is set in a grid environment with coordinates ranging from (1,1) to (4,4). Initially, each cell in this 4x4 grid is set to a state of 0, and the game's progression is tracked by a step counter starting at 0. The player, acting as the robot, takes turns by pressing any cell at coordinates (x, y), provided these coordinates are within the grid's boundaries. This action is only legal if both x and y are valid indices within the specified range. When a cell is pressed, its state changes to 4, and in subsequent turns, the state of each cell automatically decrements by one until it reaches 0, unless the cell is pressed again.

Each heap initially contains a specified number of items: heap a with 1, heap b with 5, heap c with 4, and heap d with 2. Two players, player1 and player2, participate in this game, taking turns in alternating order, with player1 starting first. The control of turns is managed by a mechanism that allows only the player in control to make a move, while the other player can only perform a 'noop' action, which effectively means doing nothing. The primary action available to a player is to reduce the number of items in a chosen heap by a certain amount, provided the amount is smaller than the current number of items in that heap. When a player performs a 'reduce' action, the heap's state updates to reflect the new number of items, and control is passed to the other player. The game imposes implicit constraints such as ensuring no heap can have a negative number of items and preventing occupancy conflicts by allowing only one player to act at a time. The game reaches its terminal state when all heaps are empty, signaling the end of the game. Scoring is determined based on control; a player who ends their turn with control receives 0 points, while the other player, who is next in line to play, is awarded 100 points, effectively making them the winner. The game's logic ensures a clear winner once all heaps are depleted, with players striving to force their opponent to be the one in control at the game's conclusion."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The robot is the sole player role, and it is responsible for making moves in a specific order, determined by the depth of the game. The initial state sets the game at depth level1 with a previous goal of zero. Players take turns by choosing a direction to move, which can be c1, c2, c3, or c4, and these moves are governed by specific legality conditions that depend on the current state and previously made choices. The game uses a noop mechanism to maintain continuity by carrying forward previous choices into the next state unless a new move is distinguished, at which point a new choice point is added. Actions by the robot can alter the game's state by either maintaining or redefining the previous goal, with certain conditions triggering automatic events such as the setting of new goals. Implicit constraints include the progression between depth levels and the requirement to avoid occupancy conflicts by adhering to defined choices. The robot's goal, which contributes to scoring, is determined by specific state conditions, and if a state does not define a new goal, the previous goal is used. The game ends when the depth reaches level5, and the robot's score is based on fulfilling criteria outlined in various state-goal mappings, with possible scores being 25, 50, 75, or 100, depending on the choices made at each depth level.

The game begins with xPlayer in control. In each turn, the player in control can either place their respective mark ('x' or 'o') on an empty cell or do nothing, known as the noop action, if it is not their turn. The legality of a move depends on whether the cell is unoccupied. After each action, the game state updates to reflect the new mark on the grid, and control alternates between the players. The game imposes constraints, such as the boundaries of the 5x5 grid, ensuring players cannot mark outside these limits or on already occupied cells. The game concludes when a player forms a complete line of five consecutive marks in any row, column, or diagonal, or when no empty cells remain. Victory is determined based on these conditions: a player who completes a line of their marks wins, receiving a score of 100, while the opponent receives a score of 0. If the grid is full without any player completing a line, the game ends in a draw, granting both players a score of 50. If the game is ongoing and neither player has completed a line, the game is not yet terminal, and the score remains undetermined.\n\nGDL code :\n(role xPlayer)\n(role oPlayer)\n\n(index 1) \n(index 2) \n(index 3) \n(index 4) \n(index 5)\n\n(init (control xPlayer))\n\n(<= (legal xPlayer noop)\n    (true (control oPlayer)))\n(<= (legal xPlayer (play ?i ?j x))\n    (true (control xPlayer))\n  (emptyCell ?i ?j))\n(<= (legal oPlayer noop)\n    (true (control xPlayer)))\n(<= (legal oPlayer (play ?i ?j o))\n    (true (control oPlayer))\n  (emptyCell ?i ?j))\n\n(<= (next (mark ?i ?j ?mark))\n    (role ?player)\n    (does ?player (play ?i ?j ?mark)))\n(<= (next (mark ?i ?j ?mark))\n    (true (mark ?i ?j ?mark)))\n(<= (next (control xPlayer))\n    (true (control oPlayer)))\n(<= (next (control oPlayer))\n    (true (control xPlayer)))\n\n(<= terminal\n    (line x))\n(<= terminal\n    (line o))\n(<= terminal\n    (not open))\n\n(<= (goal xPlayer 100)\n    (line x))\n(<= (goal xPlayer 50)\n    (not (line x))\n    (not (line o))\n    (not open))\n(<= (goal xPlayer 0)\n    (line o))\n(<= (goal xPlayer 0)\n    (not (line x))\n    (not (line o))\n    open)\n(<= (goal oPlayer 100)\n    (line o))\n(<= (goal oPlayer 50)\n    (not (line x))\n    (not (line o))\n    (not open))\n(<= (goal oPlayer 0)\n    (line x))\n(<= (goal oPlayer 0)\n    (not (line x))\n    (not (line o))\n    open)\n\n(<= (row ?i ?mark)\n    (true (mark ?i 1 ?mark))\n    (true (mark ?i 2 ?mark))\n    (true (mark ?i 3 ?mark))\n    (true (mark ?i 4 ?mark))\n    (true (mark ?i 5 ?mark)))\n(<= (col ?j ?mark)\n    (true (mark 1 ?j ?mark))\n    (true (mark 2 ?j ?mark))\n    (true (mark 3 ?j ?mark))\n    (true (mark 4 ?j ?mark))\n    (true (mark 5 ?j ?mark)))\n(<= (diag ?mark)\n    (true (mark 1 1 ?mark))\n    (true (mark 2 2 ?mark))\n    (true (mark 3 3 ?mark))\n    (true (mark 4 4 ?mark))\n    (true (mark 5 5 ?mark)))\n(<= (diag ?mark)\n    (true (mark 1 5 ?mark))\n    (true (mark 2 4 ?mark))\n    (true (mark 3 3 ?mark))\n    (true (mark 4 2 ?mark))\n    (true (mark 5 1 ?mark)))\n\n(<= (line ?mark)\n    (index ?i)\n    (row ?i ?mark))\n(<= (line ?mark)\n    (index ?j)\n    (col ?j ?mark))\n(<= (line ?mark)    \n    (diag ?mark))\n    \n(<= (emptyCell ?i ?j)\n    (index ?i)\n    (index ?j)\n    (not (true (mark ?i ?j x)))\n    (not (true (mark ?i ?j o))))\n(<= open    \n    (emptyCell ?i ?j))\n\nPlease always remember the safety rule of GDL: every variable that starts with ? must be explicitly or implicitly bound to a valid value range.\nBefore outputting any code, make sure to check that all variables are safely bound and that the generated GDL code complies with this safety requirement.\nThe final output **must** be the GDL code block only, no explanations, no comments.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "In this game, the environment is set on a grid with coordinates ranging from 1 to 2 on the x-axis and 1 to 10 on the y-axis. The player takes on the role of a robot and is the sole participant, executing actions in a sequential manner without any competition from other players. Initially, all cells in the grid are set to a value of 0, and the game begins with a counter initialized at 1. The player can choose to perform a \"press\" action on any grid cell with coordinates that fall within the defined x and y ranges. The legality of an action is determined by the cell coordinates being within these specified bounds. When the robot presses a cell, the state of that cell changes to 4 in the next turn. This triggers a cascading effect where cells decrement their values each turn, transitioning from 4 to 3, 3 to 2, 2 to 1, and 1 back to 0, while cells already at 0 remain unchanged. The counter increments with each action, and as the game progresses, certain conditions can trigger the \"lightson\" states, which are dependent on specific patterns of activated cells. The game reaches a terminal state when either the \"lightson\" state reaches 9 or the counter hits 21, signifying the end of the game. To achieve victory, the player must successfully activate a \"lightson\" state of 9, which grants a score of 100, while failing to do so results in a score of 0. Implicit constraints include the boundaries of the grid, ensuring actions are only performed within the designated coordinate system, and the mechanical occupancy conflicts that prevent multiple actions on a single cell in one turn."}], "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 3000}}

The game begins in an initial state where the round is set to 1, and each player starts with a score of zero. During each turn, a player may perform the action of selecting a number from a predefined set ranging from 1 to 10, with the condition that the action is legal if the player is a recognized participant and the selected number is within the allowed range. The game's progression is governed by transition rules where, after each round, the round number increments, and scores may change depending on the selections. If two players select the same number, no score changes occur for that number. However, if a player selects a number greater than another player's unique selection, the former player does not score. Conversely, if a player's selection is unique and not smaller than any other player's unique selection, they earn an additional ten points. The game concludes when either 25 rounds have been completed or a player reaches a score of 100 points.
