Game Checker is a program for checking game descriptions (GDL and
GDL-II) for syntactic validity (safety, stratification, etc.) and
well-formedness (playablility, winnability, ...).

To run the program:
1. Adapt the paths in setup_env.sh to your environment
2. Run the command line checker with
   $ ./gamechecker.sh

gamechecker.cgi is a perl script that provides a web-interface to
Game Checker, if installed on any cgi-enabled web server.
